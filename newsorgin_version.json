   "metin":"We're going to show you next, a little bit of a sneak peek of a brand new CBC documentary. It is called big news. It premiers today on CBC gem. So you can stream it as of today. You're going to see in this doc, the way us news, media, stoke partisan division in the us, how social media, how fake news and mistrust have politicized.

\tThe pandemic have politicized protest. Here's an excerpt of today's documentary. I think we underestimate the power of the media to shape our worldviews. We were no longer consuming the same story. People only want to watch what they already agree with. We are so polarized that we will. Polarized around.

\tAbsolutely. Anything moving ever closer to this cliff.

\tshooting guys.

\tWhen the coronavirus came along, you desperately needed to know the truth I disagree. You're where you're going to have your thoughts to where I'm at. I disagree science.

\tThey're simply incapable of reporting on the country in ways that a lot of people in the country would understand.

\tBig news from the documentary. Look who's with us this morning, our senior correspondent in Washington, Paul Hunter, my heart is pounding for, from that promo. I mean, obviously. It is a very dramatic documentary, but it gets to some very important issues. And Paul is with us this morning to talk about things good morning and welcome back.

\tNice to see you Paul for a long time. I know I was thinking it was inauguration day, January 20th, that we last saw you. And we're going to talk about some of the things that relate to that, but let me get you to get your perspective overall, this documentary, what, what you see it's trying to do, because part of your work is part of this, but, uh, what you see the documentary is trying to do and how it mirrors.

\tWhat you have experienced and witnessed in your 10 years covering the US political scene, such a, such a small, simple question, Heather, you know, I hear your voice in it for a snippet, or there's a snippet of me, sympathy of our friend, Steve D'Souza, but mostly it looks at the US media and the sort of, what it really tries to do is connect the dots.

\tTo explain or try to how we got to where we are right now, which is, you know, a place where people don't trust the news, where people don't know where to find the news and what to think of it. When they see it, how did we get here? How did this country society get to a place where it is so polarized, where there aren't conversations anymore?

\tThere are just angry, shouting matches. Among politicians among media. How do people find the truth? How did we get here? It tracks, it goes back to the Dawn of public broadcasting, but mostly it looks really at the last 20, 30 years, uh, during the rise of this period, that again gets us to the point where we are now.

\tIt's quite a dark, I've watched the whole thing. That was a great little promo. And it's about an hour long it's, um, it's instructive and it's kind of sobering, you know, because we've come to. No, the world was at a point where they thought, you know, all information will come from the news. And now the news is questioned.

\tDoubted not believed. By millions of people. And that's a challenge for democracy, little clip for you, Paul, and it's not from the documentary, but it just speaks to how the current president Joe Biden is dealing with the climate that exists presently and how people don't believe that they are getting the truth.

\tSo let's watch this and then we'll, we'll bring it back to the, uh, the discussion last summer I was in Philadelphia and I met a small business owner, a woman. I asked her, I said, what do you need most, never get what she said to me. She said, looking from behind the ice, he said, I just want the truth, the truth.

\tJust tell me the truth. Think of that. My fellow Americans you're owed nothing less than the truth. So as he addressed the American population there in that prime primetime special. I just want the truth. When, when did that departure occur? Paul, you know, I thought there was a remarkable moment, uh, in Biden's speech, uh, that night, a couple of weeks ago.

\tUm, you kind of hear that from people all the time. You know, if I'm going out talking to, you know, regular people, uh, it's interesting. The last, I would say the last 10, 15 years, people want to know who you work for. Uh, what's your agenda. Do you have an agenda? What is your network about, what is your story about because people, they are wary of bias.

\tThey are wary of non-truths and like, you know, the woman in Joe Biden's story, people just want the truth and they don't know how to find it. You know, in the documentary, to me, there's a couple of turning points in all of this. There's the rise of Fox news. There's Donald Trump and, and the repetition of fake news and all that kind of stuff.

\tBut at one point, the documentary looks at, um, the, the program crossfire, if you remember that, um, where they would get somebody on, on the left and somebody on the right and have what was ostensibly a debate and what extensively presented as a kind of news and information program. Um, but what the documentary underlines is that it was, it was, it was an us versus them.

\tIt was a, this team versus that team. And that, that. Isn't really helpful. They, they show a Jon Stewart clip where he calls them out on this. Um, and what that program led to was a polarization of people. It's us, them there's no middle ground. You know, I talk to journalism students a lot, uh, over the, over the course of years.

\tAnd yeah, I have often made the point that that you'll encounter a tension to be, you know, One side or the other, because that's somehow sexier the, that the tension in that is makes for a sexier more interesting story, but right. But the truth is usually somewhere in the middle and your job is to get to the truth.

\tSometimes all the time, that's not black or white, that's gray. Your job is to make that story interesting and valuable, but that's what the news is about the truth and get to the truth. So get away from the, this side or that side of the shouting matches that can ensue. It may be. Entertaining to watch, but it's at the end of the day, it, it may not be valuable for people that are just trying to get information.

\tSo interesting. Would you talk about the polarization and then the fact that, I mean, as we heard in that promo clip, that people only are interested in listening what they already believe. You know, they're not listening and learning to the other side or talking to the other side or it's that echo chamber mentality that continues.

\tI want to bring back. We saw that image very briefly, but when you bring in fake news, this phrase that we all know, uh, alternative facts, I think back to that from 2017, that was a key turning point moment I would imagine. But. With the election of Donald Trump. And then now of late the pandemic, here's the picture that we're going to look as, you know, that when he returned from the hospital, after having being treated for COVID-19 and makes that triumphant return up the steps of the white house, uh, just bear with me.

\tWe're going to look at that image again. Oh, it is eclipse or Paul will watch this and we'll talk about it in just a second. Sure. Yeah.

\tSo, sorry. There is no sound there. Yeah, there's the image. And then that. Cam, you can see the bulbs flashing he's up the stairs and there he is. And he takes off the mask. How has all of that Trump and the pandemic, how was it all exacerbated? Things know there's another, you know, another, I think, um, instructive moment in the documentary, uh, uh, where it's Leslie stall from 60 minutes talking with Donald Trump about his sort of perpetual, um, disparaging of the news and you know, the fake news, et cetera.

\tAnd he says she recounts that he tells her. That he says that so that people will believe him, not people who are filtering his message or, or saying what they want about. And they will only believe him. I've I've, you know, thought for a long time. The two most powerful words in his lexicon were fake news.

\tAnd he had been to places where he will do that at those rallies. And then people will turn and do the CNN sucks, you know, to the media pen in the middle. And he creates, he again, builds on this. You're on one team or the other you're either with me or you're with the, you know, the enemy of the people, the media, as he put it.

\tAnd you know, we talk about the bully pulpit that the president has. When you say this often enough as president people tend to believe it. Right. And that's a challenge for the media. I mean, we've got to do our job. We've got to call that out. We've got to fact check. We've got to tell stories. We've got to demonstrate what the other side is.

\tBut it's complicated and it's hard because that's a very powerful position to be in as president, you know, even, you know, during COVID for example, when he comes out and he starts talking about, you know, hydroxychloroquine or bleach or sunlight, and by he, I mean, any president, right? How do you, how do you know what the truth is?

\tEven as a journalist, maybe he heard something in the oval office that he's, he can't really explain. There's not a Liberty to, or whatever, or is it just wrong or is it a false information or is it a lie you don't know. And how do you get to that? It's kind of circular in the end, but it has become a complicated thing to do it, it, you know, to cover politics in this country in the last 10, 15.

\tSo let's look to consequences in the future and I'm going to. Bask for some footage of what we saw on January the sixth. When you talk about the presidential bully pulpit, and you can see in these pictures of the Capitol riots, you see how people responded to what the president said, the consequences of this kind of, uh, of this kind of discussion.

\tThen it makes you wander again in, in, in conjunction with this documentary, Paul, the consequences of this debate and in this kind of messaging and how on earth do we ever get it back? Look Heather, the thing is the other, I think failure of big media, the industry, not the documentary, um, is for too long, too many news organizations, um, ignored too many voices in America.

\tYou know, the reason the us versus them grabbed hold. Is because people outside of New York people outside of the Washington beltway people outside of Los Angeles, outside the major media centers felt, I think rightly that their voices were not a part of the conversation, um, about life in America, about politics in America, they didn't show up on the big news shows and.

\tThus, they felt left out. And so when someone comes along, who promises them to make their country great again, uh, that's an easy thing to want to be a part of because nobody else is listening to you. And I think one of the points that the documentary underlines is that that was a failure of media to reflect all voices in America.

\tAnd we're all sort of paying the price for that now. Lessons for so many in all of this, Paul, thank you for that wisdom and that experience shared and, uh, will appreciate hearing your voice. I didn't know. I had a snippet in there too. We're all part of it as of today. Uh, thank you, Paul Hunter, our senior correspondent from Washington and that CBC news, original documentary again, big news available right now.

\tYou can stream it on CBC gem.",

   "metin":"That’s Israel firing missiles into Northern Gaza as Hamas fires over 45 rockets aimed towards Jerusalem.

This is according to new reporting out from the IDF.

That’s the Israeli defense force.

It comes as tensions.

Continue to ratch up in the region.

Following what has been a week’s long new spate of military conflict Trey Gates joins us now from Israel with details on the ground.

Hi Trey.

Jillian good afternoon.

This was a red line for Israel firing on Jerusalem.

Earlier this evening, seven rockets targeted the city and dozens of rockets have targeted communities along the Gaza border here where we are standing.

The past 30 minutes have been quiet.

But the IDF, the Israeli defense forces are preparing.

They say four days of fighting along the Gaza border.

If we spoke earlier with sources inside Gaza who have confirmed that the Israelis are now responding with airstrikes inside the Gaza strip.

\tAccording to the Palestinian health ministry, nine Gazans have been killed, including.

\tThree children in this Israeli, retaliation.

\tHow did we get here? That’s the big question? Well, this week has been extremely tense.

\tThere were protests across Jerusalem that turned to riots early this morning, more than 300 Palestinians were injured at the Al-Aqsa mosque as Israeli security forces stormed in all of this related to two major issues.

\tHaving to do with access to a Locksa and also the shake Jarrod neighborhood in Jerusalem.

\tThose are very local and focused issues for this conflict.

\tBut as we have seen tonight, this is evolving into a much larger situation.

\tI want to get just some information that we’re getting here from the Israeli military, they are calling this a severe assault on Israel.

They say they hold Hamas.

\tThe group in control of Gaza, responsible saying Hamas will bear the consequences.

\tWe also know according to the Israeli defense spokesperson that.

\tA Hamas military commander was targeted in some of this Israeli retaliation this hour.

\tAnd this takes things to a different level inside Gaza because the factions there then say they need to respond.

There are two big factions inside Gaza.

One is Hamas and the other is Islamic jihad.

\tBoth of them have fired rockets tonight into Southern Israel and central Israel in the past, the last major round.

Only focused on Islamic jihad.

\tSo the fact that Hamas is getting involved in the fight means that this is turning into a serious conflict for the region.

\tAnd as you can see behind me, police have blocked off roads leading to the Gaza border itself.

\tWe’re just about a mile away from the border and there are bomb shelters opened all around us.

\tIt’s very quiet in this city of stood up because people are preparing for further conflict.

Trey.

Thanks for being there for us.

Stay safe.

We’ll check back in with you later.

Appreciate it.",

   "metin":"When it was happening to me, I thought that I was the only one, not only with him, but in the world who is surviving, something like this. Serbian actor Milena Redulovic shared her story of rape in January. It was like a dumb  broke setting off a metoo wave empowering women across the region to speak up about a taboo subject.

\tWell, this story is shaped Serbia from the gound. Milena has accused famous produce and drama teacher Miroslav Alexi of raping her when she was 17 and studying at the prestigious acting school in Belgrade, several other women from the same school have come forward with similar accusations. Alexa has since been charged with rape and other illegal sexual acts.

\tHe denies wrongdoing and is being held in detention, the publicity around the case, unleash the tide of testimonies and brought another case back into the spotlight. I remember clearly, um, hearing about Milena's story and being in tears of joy, I was just thinking of that. My mission to encourage other people to speak has started.

\tDaniella Steinfeld is a Serbian filmmaker now based in New York.

\tLast year, she released a documentary examining the aftermath of sexual assault. Including her own recently, she revealed the name of the man. She says raped her well-known Serbian actor Branislav Lečić who denies the allegation. Others have come out with similar accusations and investigation is underway and no charges have yet been made violence against women is a serious concern in Serbia.

\tThe country ratified this symbol convention to protect women, but reporting and conviction rates are extremely low. Most of the victims in the Balkan region are still in silence. The self silencing is a self protection because one thing is to survive sexual assault and reach for safety. The other thing is to survive the unpredictability of a backlash disbelief, shaming.

\tDaniela left Serbia, abandoning her successful acting career there from a PTSD and from pretty much dysfunctional person that I was for years, I raise up to make the film to make something that it was helpful for many people. And that is something that has healed me. For Milena, one reason to share her story was to make people see what's been hiding in plain sight.

\tI knew that it is going to be interesting for everybody because I was this protected princess girl from a good family and everybody would have like, Oh, she's leading such a fairytale. So I knew that it's going to be like, Oh my God, like her, if I kept talked to Daniella, um, right after the assaults, um, I would tell her.

\tUh, to not be afraid, go tell your parents now. Yeah. And I would tell her that it's not only your case. And to know that no matter how difficult and long, long, long time it's needed, the healing is possible.",

India’s new COVID-19 wave spreading like ‘wildfire’: UNICEF

\tA new wave of COVID-19 infections is spreading like “wildfire” across India, leaving many youngsters destitute, the UN Children’s Fund UNICEF said on Friday.

\tIn the last 24 hours, India registered nearly 4,000 coronavirus deaths and over 414,000 cases; “the highest daily case count recorded by any country in the history of (the) COVID-19 pandemic”, said Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF Representative in India.

\tThe impact on children has been dire, she said, highlighting the increased risk of violence, as lockdowns have closed the usual places of protection for youngsters, such as school.

\t“We haven’t seen yet any indication that the proportion is any different to what we saw in the first wave, however the numbers are far greater; we’ve seen the virus entering a household; it just takes one member in the household to be affected and it seems to spread like wildfire throughout the family.” 

\tThere has also been a spike in illegal adoption pleas on internet platforms by families desperate to find homes for orphaned relatives, the UN official said, in a call to promote family tracing and speedier help for vulnerable families.

Attacks force thousands to flee in Burkina Faso

\tTo Burkina Faso now, where aid agencies are deeply concerned by violence that’s  killed 45 people and forced more than 17,000 to flee their homes in the last 10 days.

\tThe alert from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, comes after gunmen carried out attacks in three separate regions, burning down houses and killing civilians.

\tThe armed groups – described in reports as jihadists - also ransacked health centres and damaged homes and shops during a series of attacks in the East, North and Sahel regions.

\tUNHCR spokesperson Boris Cheshirkov told journalists in Geneva that the victims were now fleeing towards larger and more secure urban centres, often arriving “with few or no belongings”.

\tThey are in urgent need of food, shelter, clean water, and health care, Mr Cheshirkov said, adding that violence in Burkina Faso has forced well over one million people to flee their homes in search of safety in the last two years.

Probe call into Rio favella police operation that left 25 dead

\tFinally to Brazil, and a call from the UN rights office for an independent investigation into a police operation in a Rio favella that left at least 25 dead.

\tThe call from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) comes after police officers on the ground and in a helicopter overhead reportedly opened fire on a heavily built up residential neighbourhood during an operation against organised crime.

\tOHCHR spokesperson Rupert Colville said that Thursday’s incident was probably the “deadliest” operation of its kind in more than a decade.”:

\t“I think there’s sort of a widespread responsibility here, shared responsibility. Yes of course, there are political sides to it, but you have the institutions which control these operations and you have the judiciaries, you have the police, you have the judiciary, you have the ministries involved in these kind of investigations and operations. So it appears, as you say, that collectively, you know, they’re not succeeding in stopping these kind of really disturbing over the top lethal operations.”

\tMr Colville noted that the operation had taken place despite a Supreme Court ruling last year which restricted police operations in Rio’s favelas during the COVID-19 pandemic.

   "authorImage":"https://github.com/Boga28/news/raw/main/NewsChannelImages/VOA.png",
   "metin":"Four former police officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota last year are to face a federal civil rights trial.

\tA federal grand jury has decided to bring charges against the four accusing them of violating George Floyd’s constitutional rights. A grand jury is a group of citizens who study evidence to decide if there should be a trial in a legal case. The decision was made public Friday.

\tFloyd died after officers restrained him on the ground during his arrest on May 25, 2020. During the arrest, Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe in an incident which was filmed and shown all over the world.

The charges

\tDerek Chauvin is charged with violating Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force.

\tTou Thao and J Alexander Keung are also charged with violating Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure. The charging document alleges that the two did not try to stop Chauvin as he put a knee on Floyd’s neck.

All four officers, Chauvin, Keung, Thao, and Thomas Lane, are charged with failure to provide Floyd with medical care.

\tChauvin is also charged in connection with the arrest and restraint of a 14-year-old boy in 2017.

\tThree of the former officers, Lane, Thao and Keung, appeared before the US District Court in Minneapolis through a video link. Chauvin was not part of the court appearance.

\tIn April, a court in Minneapolis found Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter charges brought by the state of Minnesota. He is being held in a high security prison in the state as he waits for his sentence to be decided by a judge.

\tThe three former officers named by the federal grand jury also face state charges in a trial planned for August. They are free after paying a bond to ensure that they appear for trial.

The incident

\tThe charges are the result of the arrest of Floyd last year. The officers stopped Floyd after he was accused of trying to use false money at a store and acting unusually. Court evidence states that Floyd resisted being arrested.

\tChauvin then restrained Floyd on the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes. State lawyers say that Kueng placed his knee on Floyd’s back and Lane held down Floyd’s legs during the arrest. The state lawyers also say Thao held a gathering crowd back and prevented them from intervening in the arrest.

\tEric Nelson, Chauvin’s lawyer argued during his murder trial that the former officer acted reasonably in the situation. He said that Floyd died of existing health problems and was using drugs at the time. He also requested a new trial for Chauvin noting several issues. Among the issues was that the judge did not move the trial to another place although the incident caused violent protests in Minneapolis.

\tFloyd’s arrest was captured on video by many people who gathered around the arrest. The incident brought public anger and protests, both peaceful and violent, across the country against police use of force and racial inequality.

   "imageCaption":"First-year teacher Cindy Hipps stands outside of Lagos Elementary School, at Manor Independent School District campus east of Austin, Texas (Acacia Coronado/Report for America via AP)",
   "authorImage":"https://github.com/Boga28/news/raw/main/NewsChannelImages/nbc.png",
   "metin":"Ana Saul Romero has seen many changes in teaching methods, testing, and technology during her forty years as a teacher. But this year, she said, has given her a lifetime’s worth of changes.
\n\tIn her first-grade class in Manor, Texas, just outside of Austin, only 12 students are inside the classroom. The other half of the class join in from home by video. Romero now stands behind a clear divider working with a pointer, a laptop, and a few other technologies to teach her students.
\nSuper teachers
\n\tRomero said, “it is difficult with the technology, and I have learned more, but it is not enough, it is never enough.” She said she is from an older generation and she misses the daily, in-person connections with her students.
\n\tFirst-year teacher Cindy Hipps is Romero’s teaching partner. She said it was like being “introduced to the ring of fire of teaching.” She added, “I feel like a superwoman now.”
\n\tThis spring marks a year since the coronavirus pandemic shut down schools across the United States. It forced many students, parents, and teachers into virtual classrooms.
\n\tAs states permitted larger groups to gather, some students have since returned to school. Many schools now use a combination of virtual and in-person instruction in class. And teachers like Romero have to learn new ways of teaching all the students.
\nLast school year
\n\tAdding to the difficulties, not all students have equal access to internet and technology. There were political and social protests across the country. And many tired educators are wondering if this will be their last school year.
\n\tAntoinette Miranda is an Ohio State University professor of school psychology. She is also on the state’s school board and is married to a high school teacher.
\n\tShe said that educators are dealing with the pandemic’s effects on themselves and their family. They also are trying to support students, some with troubles in school and some without food at home while being separated from friends.
\n\t“We talk a lot about the stress on students,” Miranda said, “but I think there’s a tremendous amount of stress on teachers.”
\n\tSome people blamed teachers who raised concerns on health and safety for delaying school re-openings. They felt it put pressure on parents. But Miranda thinks “there’s also a renewed respect for teachers. especially parents that had to start teaching their kids at home.”
\n\tAndre Spencer is head of the Manor Independent School District where Romero works. He said the schools centered on helping students and teachers during the pandemic. They spent millions to provide every student and teacher the technology for virtual learning, including mobile internet access.
\n\tEven before the start of this school year, school supervisors like Spencer were already worried that there would be a shortage of teachers and school workers.
\n\tThe National Education Association is one of the nation’s largest representatives for teachers. The organization found that more than one in four teachers felt the pandemic increased their plans to retire early or leave the profession.
\n\tRandi Weingarten is president of American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, another teacher’s organization. She believes there will be more teachers retiring in the coming months after a year of unknowns, change, and stress. And AFT has started a program to help members who were affected by COVID-19.
\nTeaching controversial topics
\n\tBut there were other issues that affect teachers, especially teachers of color, this past year. They include national conversations around racial injustice, the presidential election, and the attack on the US Capitol.
\n\tTravis Bristol is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He suggests schools provide employees time to talk about what they have been through. He says teachers who have been supported in dealing with their own stress will be better able to help students do the same.
\n\tRomero, the first-grade teacher in Texas, was considering retiring. But she now looks forward to the new school year.
\n\tShe said, “We will have the experience of an entire year of trying. That’s what educators do. We try and we fail and we get up and we shake it off and we do it again.”
