Ronald Garcia is a 39-year-old Guatemalan man who recently entered the United States illegally.

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:17,360
He is currently at Casa Alitas, a shelter for immigrants in Tucson, Arizona.

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,340
While there, he told about his border crossing.

4
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:30,765
Garcia said he paid smugglers $20,000 to get him across the border.

5
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:36,825
He said he had to sell all he owned to come to the US.

6
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:46,115
Crossing into the United States illegally is a big business in Central and South America.

7
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:52,235
Many people leave their countries due to the violence and poverty.

8
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:58,305
They pay huge amounts of money and risk their lives to leave.

9
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:13,875
Garcia said of his experience, “They put me in a trunk where you couldn’t breathe, and well, thank God (I survived), because they say that all those who are put there, they die.”

10
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:21,105
The US Border Patrol (USBP) says illegal smuggling operations are big business.

11
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:40,080
A RAND Corporation study estimated smugglers made between $200 million and $2,3 billion in 2017 transporting people into the US, mostly from Central America.

12
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,450
USPB spokesman Mario Escalante said it is a dangerous business as well.

13
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:57,090
He said smugglers sometimes abandon the migrants, steal from them, rape them and worse.

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,370
Garcia agrees.

15
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:09,720
"They ask for a quantity of money, and if they don't get it by the time and date they say, they'll kill you,” he said.

16
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,000
Henry Cuellar is a US lawmaker from Texas.

17
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:26,250
The congressional area he represents stretches from San Antonio to the border town of McAllen in southern Texas.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,680
Cuellar told VOA that smugglers also provide transport for illegal drug traffickers.

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,100
But it is not just criminal organizations making money from immigrants.

20
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:53,645
Private research business Dynamic Securities Analytics reports that the American financial industry also profits from the illegal business.

21
00:02:54,935 --> 00:03:01,985
They profit from fees connected to electronic payments made by undocumented immigrants.

22
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:07,685
President Joe Biden supports extensive immigration reform.

23
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,520
Biden has also warned migrants against making illegal border crossings.

24
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,480
Former ambassador Roberta Jacobson is Biden’s adviser on southern border issues.

25
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:32,960
She told VOA that the administration is working with foreign intelligence sources to fight human smuggling operations.

26
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,450
I’m John Russell.
