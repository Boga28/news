00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,860
We're going to show you next, a little bit of a sneak peek of a brand new CBC documentary.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,750
It is called big news.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,330
It premiers today on CBC gem.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,280
So you can stream it as of today.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:22,260
You're going to see in this doc, the way us news, media, stoke partisan division in the us, how social media, how fake news and mistrust have politicized.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,380
The pandemic have politicized protest.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,630
Here's an excerpt of today's documentary.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,850
I think we underestimate the power of the media to shape our worldviews.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,019
We were no longer consuming the same story.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,750
People only want to watch what they already agree with.

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,905
We are so polarized that we will polarized around absolutely, Anything.

12
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:56,345
Moving ever closer to this cliff.

13
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:08,215
“Shooting guys”.

14
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:16,380
When the coronavirus came along, you desperately needed to know the truth.

15
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:21,600
“I disagree, you're where you're going to have your thoughts to where I'm at.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,919
I disagree science”.

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,639
They're simply incapable of reporting on the country in ways that a lot of people in the country would understand.

18
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:44,935
Big news from the documentary.

19
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:52,345
Look who's with us this morning, our senior correspondent in Washington, Paul Hunter, my heart is pounding for, from that promo.

20
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,515
I mean, obviously.

21
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,765
It is a very dramatic documentary, but it gets to some very important issues.

22
00:01:57,765 --> 00:02:02,205
And Paul is with us this morning to talk about things good morning and welcome back.

23
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:03,304
Nice to see you Paul.

24
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,335
For a long time.

25
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:08,595
I know I was thinking it was inauguration day, January 20th, that we last saw you.

26
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:21,565
And we're going to talk about some of the things that relate to that, but let me get you to get your perspective overall, this documentary, what, what you see it's trying to do, because part of your work is part of this, but, uh, what you see the documentary is trying to do and how it mirrors.

27
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:43,600
What you have experienced and witnessed in your 10 years covering the US political scene, such a, such a small, simple question, Heather, you know, I hear your voice in it for a snippet, or there's a snippet of me, sympathy of our friend, Steve D'Souza, but mostly it looks at the US media and the sort of, what it really tries to do is connect the dots.

28
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:58,065
To explain or try to how we got to where we are right now, which is, you know, a place where people don't trust the news, where people don't know where to find the news and what to think of it.

29
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,255
When they see it, how did we get here?.

30
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:08,265
How did this country society get to a place where it is so polarized, where there aren't conversations anymore.

31
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:10,755
There are just angry, shouting matches.

32
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,340
Among politicians among media.

33
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,440
How do people find the truth?.

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,640
How did we get here?.
