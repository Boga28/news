1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:09,110
They‛re the skin crawling images viewed by millions of people, worldwide.

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,160
Millions of mice pouring out of sheds.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,250
Through farms, beds, kitchens, and overloads.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:23,840
Yes.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:35,720
It‛s making daily life and ordeal for those who live and farm in Western new south Wales, I went out one evening and so.

6
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:39,645
Just literally thousands and thousands crawling over my haystack.

7
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:43,565
They were all in the house out of the chook yard, just running around.

8
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:50,435
You‛d go out in the evening and they were just, the ground was just covered in mass, running around it‛s devastating.

9
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,835
It‛s um, I think it‛s 80% ruined

10
00:00:57,065 --> 00:01:02,165
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of hay and grain across the region is now worthless.

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,370
And many farmers have no option, but to burn it.

12
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,190
So you can see here, they‛ve eaten all the tops off these plants, so that plant won‛t survive.

13
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,080
And they‛ve gone right along here.

14
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:28,460
Nick can amble and colonies working from sunrise to sunset, to Soho her winter crop.

15
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:35,905
She‛s spreading poisonous bait in her fields to keep the rodents at bay, but it‛s not working.

16
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,365
It was just so relentless.

17
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:45,945
It just every day we were going out and putting out the mouse, pate, and I just didn‛t seem to be getting anywhere.

18
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:56,835
The mouse plague is estimated to have cost farmers almost $100 million, but the endless waves of mice are also taking a toll on their mental health.

19
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,175
Obviously, a lot of us live off rainwater.

20
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:07,955
And so the fact that we‛ve got mice in our rainwater tanks has been, you know, bloody horrible, Frank, frankly, your one source of water on a property.

21
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:12,365
And you‛ve got mice in it last week.

22
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,935
The new south Wales government announced a $50 million support package.

23
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:23,835
It includes free Bates, but no financial help for farmers spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on rodent control.

24
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:28,385
The latest support that‛s been announced is eight months too late for us.

25
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:33,245
And I‛ve spent over $40,000 with buying the mouse bait.

26
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:38,644
We really need a bit of compensation for that now because we can‛t afford it.

27
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:42,915
During the day, you wouldn‛t even know there‛s a mouse plague here.

28
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:55,185
Although there is plenty of evidence of the damage they cause, but it‛s at night that they come out in their thousands, running across roads, crawling through homes and ravaging haystacks like this one bots.

29
00:02:55,195 --> 00:03:01,484
The worst part is if this problem isn‛t contained during winter, it‛s all going to get so much worse.

30
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:07,864
Our concern is if we get a high level of over winter survival than.

31
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,800
Well, ice will start to breed early from a high population base.

32
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,230
And, um, then the, the number of mice will increase very dramatically at that point.

33
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,470
CSI row researcher, Steve Henry has been working with farmers.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,615
He says the plague is showing no signs of slowing down and is actually spreading across the country.

35
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:41,217
We‛re getting more and more reports through the, the Riverina and into Northern Victoria.

36
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:47,325
And we‛re even starting to get some reports of really high numbers from the York peninsula in south Australia as well.

37
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:01,353
People aren‛t spending  money.

38
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:02,187
They‛re not.

39
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,995
We‛re not the only ones in town that are struggling.

40
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:11,935
We was what, a month ago that we were the only shop in this block.

41
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:25,095
The play could prove the final straw for regional businesses like this family run bakery in narrow mind, Robert and Carrie Brennan say the triple whammy of drought, pandemic and mouse.

42
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,945
Plague has seen business drop by 40%.

43
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,485
They have gone from 28 to eight employees.

44
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:38,805
Buying storage containers, buying diffusers to keep the smell out of the shop.

45
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,015
Seeing customers seeing mice run around.

46
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:55,385
I mean, no wonder were not doing that great at the moment, but what can we do？ So that‛s a huge impact on business while they can claim a thousand dollar rebate from the state government.

47
00:04:55,625 --> 00:05:00,485
The Brendan say their bakery and many other businesses in town may not survive the year.

48
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:02,985
Something needs to be done.

49
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:03,937
Otherwise we‛ll closed.

50
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,825
I don‛t know if it will be still here at Christmas.

51
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,070
People put on a brave face, they still go out and do their shopping.

52
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:23,130
They still smile and interact that you know that at the back of their mind, the fact that the mice are in their homes, they‛re in the food preparation areas, they‛re in their beds, in their, in their linen press.

53
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,821
And there‛s been no insurance.

54
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:26,400
There‛s no coverage for rodent damage.

55
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:35,330
In most cases and colonies fighting on to try to save her crop and bounce back from the drought she wants.

56
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,210
The effects of the plague will eventually be felt in the cities we‛re producing crops.

57
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,140
That feed the nation.

58
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,913
So, uh, there‛ll be no bread  war.

59
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:51,135
There‛ll be much higher prices for bread and biscuits and limp.

60
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:54,835
If they‛re ruining valley crops, the beer prices will go up.

61
00:05:54,835 --> 00:06:00,025
So it‛s a flow on it.

62
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:03,484
Hi, I‛m Lee sales.
