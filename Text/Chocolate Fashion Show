Salon du Chocolat created clothing made of chocolate and models wore the creations at a fashion show in Paris which was part of an annual chocolate fair.

People say that the fair is the largest chocolate fair in the world. Chocolatiers, pastry chefs and confectioners come from across the world to this fair.

In the movie ‘Forrest Gump’, the main character said that, ‘Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re going to get’. Clearly, fashion shows can be like boxes of chocolates, too!
    
Difficult words: chocolatier (a person who creates chocolate and things made out of chocolate), confectioner (a person who works with candy and sweets), Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re going to get. (this saying means that you do not know what life is going to be like in the future)
