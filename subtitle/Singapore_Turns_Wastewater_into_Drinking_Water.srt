00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,310
The government of Singapore has created a highly developed system that turns wastewater into drinking water.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,870
The system involves a network of tunnels and high-technology treatment centers.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,040
Reused wastewater can now meet 40 percent of Singapore's water demand.

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:35,490
The country’s water agency says it expects to meet 55 percent of Singapore’s water demand by the year 2060.

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:45,030
Most of the water is used for microchip manufacturing centers and cooling systems in buildings.

6
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,160
But some of it is added to the country’s drinking water supplies.

7
00:00:52,435 --> 00:01:01,265
The system helps reduce ocean pollution, as only a small amount of the treated water is sent into the sea.

8
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:13,975
The United Nations estimates that 80 percent of the world's wastewater flows back into the oceans without being treated or reused.

9
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,075
Singapore has few natural water sources.

10
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:27,490
The island nation has long had to depend mostly on supplies from neighboring Malaysia.

11
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:36,010
Low Pei Chin is chief engineer of the water reclamation department of the Public Utilities Board.

12
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:53,685
She told reporters with Agence France-Press, “Singapore lacks natural resources, and it is limited in space, which is why we are always looking for ways to explore water sources and stretch our water supply”.

13
00:01:55,125 --> 00:02:02,055
One major plan is to “collect every drop” and “reuse endlessly,” she added.

14
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:11,625
The Changi Water Reclamation Plant on Singapore’s eastern coast is the main part of the country’s recycling system.

15
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,930
Parts of the water treatment center are underground.

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,640
Wastewater enters the center through a 48-kilometer tunnel that is linked to sewers.

17
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:35,560
The center contains a large system of steel pipes, tubes, tanks, cleaning systems and other machinery.

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,910
It can treat up to 900 million liters of wastewater a day.

19
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:53,530
In one building, a network of air flow systems has been put in place to keep the air smelling as fresh as possible.

20
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:06,590
Waste that arrives at the plant goes through a cleaning process before powerful pumps send it flowing to areas above ground for more treatment.

21
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,350
There, the treated water receives additional cleaning.

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:22,970
Bacteria and viruses are removed through highly developed cleaning processes and disinfected with ultraviolet radiation.

23
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,160
Singapore is also in the process of expanding its recycling system.

24
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:40,780
The country will add another underground tunnel and a major water treatment center to serve the western half of the island.

25
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,380
Officials expect work on the center to be completed by 2025.

26
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:58,870
By the time the expansion is finished, Singapore will have spent about $7,4 billion on its water treatment systems.

27
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,019
