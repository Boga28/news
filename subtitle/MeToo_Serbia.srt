1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:11,610
When it was happening to me, I thought that I was the only one, not only with him, but in the world who is surviving, something like this.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,250
Serbian actor Milena Redulovic shared her story of rape in January.

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:24,320
It was like a dumb  broke setting off a metoo wave empowering women across the region to speak up about a taboo subject.

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,020
Well, this story is shaped Serbia from the gound.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:42,114
Milena has accused famous produce and drama teacher Miroslav Alexi of raping her when she was 17 and studying at the prestigious acting school in Belgrade, several other women from the same school have come forward with similar accusations.

6
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,435
Alexa has since been charged with rape and other illegal sexual acts.

7
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:56,095
He denies wrongdoing and is being held in detention, the publicity around the case, unleash the tide of testimonies and brought another case back into the spotlight.

8
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:03,470
I remember clearly, um, hearing about Milena's story and being in tears of joy, I was just thinking of that.

9
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,780
My mission to encourage other people to speak has started.

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,700
Daniella Steinfeld is a Serbian filmmaker now based in New York.

11
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,890
Last year, she released a documentary examining the aftermath of sexual assault.

12
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,649
Including her own recently, she revealed the name of the man.

13
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:33,259
She says raped her well-known Serbian actor Branislav Lečić who denies the allegation.

14
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:43,850
Others have come out with similar accusations and investigation is underway and no charges have yet been made violence against women is a serious concern in Serbia.

15
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,630
The country ratified this symbol convention to protect women, but reporting and conviction rates are extremely low.

16
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:54,215
Most of the victims in the Balkan region are still in silence.

17
00:01:54,274 --> 00:02:03,005
The self silencing is a self protection because one thing is to survive sexual assault and reach for safety.

18
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:09,845
The other thing is to survive the unpredictability of a backlash disbelief, shaming.

19
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:25,540
Daniela left Serbia, abandoning her successful acting career there from a PTSD and from pretty much dysfunctional person that I was for years, I raise up to make the film to make something that it was helpful for many people.

20
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,609
And that is something that has healed me.

21
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:34,035
For Milena, one reason to share her story was to make people see what's been hiding in plain sight.

22
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:44,435
i knew that it is going to be interesting for everybody because I was this protected princess girl from a good family and everybody would have like, Oh, she's leading such a fairytale.

23
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:55,895
So I knew that it's going to be like, Oh my God, like her, if I kept talked to Daniella, um, right after the assaults, um, I would tell her.

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,560
Uh, to not be afraid, go tell your parents now.

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,530
Yeah, and I would tell her that it's not only your case.

26
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:17,280
And to know that no matter how difficult and long, long, long time it's needed, the healing is possible.
