00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:12,570
Olympic gymnastics champion Sunisa Lee’s life changed when her new gold medal was placed around her neck Thursday.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,520
Her future plans, however, have not changed.

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:27,795
Lee narrowly defeated Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade for the gold medal in the women’s all around.

4
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:42,305
Just one day after her victory, Lee said she is ready to start her student life at Auburn University in the southern US state of Alabama.

5
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:47,825
She plans to compete for the college’s gymnastics team.

6
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:56,215
First-year students are expected to report to their dormitory rooms on August 11.

7
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,320
Lee told The Associated Press she plans to be there.

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:11,900
“(College) just has been another one of my dreams and goals after the Olympics,” the 18-year-old said Friday.

9
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:20,970
“So, I feel like if I were to going to go pro, it would have to be like something like really good,” she added.

10
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:26,505
To “go pro” means to become a professional athlete.

11
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:36,535
Until recently, going pro was the only way Lee could have accepted major product endorsements.

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:53,330
The past four Olympic champions in the women’s gymnastics all-around have been American: Carly Patterson, Nastia Liukin, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles.

13
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,010
They, like Lee, were teenagers at the time of their victories.

14
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,720
None of them competed in college sports.

15
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,380
Instead, they chose to go professional to make money from their newfound fame.

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,500
But things were different then.

17
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,700
Gymnasts had to choose between high-paying endorsements and college sports scholarships.

18
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:31,095
However, recently passed legislation permits college athletes to make money off their name, image and likeness.

19
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:36,765
There will be no shortage of possibilities for Lee to earn money.

20
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:41,595
She is the first Hmong American to win an Olympic medal.

21
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:49,155
She has huge support from the Hmong community in the United States and around the world.

22
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:58,650
Whatever comes next, however, she plans to be competing for Auburn’s gymnastics team next spring.

23
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,700
The move to college gymnastics should be easy.

24
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:12,270
Lee’s longtime trainer Jess Graba and Auburn gymnastics coach Jeff Graba are twin brothers.

25
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:26,190
Jeff Graba said Lee can compete in college while also enjoying the financial rewards from being a gold medalist in one of the most popular Olympic sports.

26
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,880
That is something no other American Olympic champion has been able to do before.

27
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:44,355
When she starts her college life in Alabama, Lee will leave behind her family and Hmong community in the state of Minnesota.

28
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:51,044
There are about 250,000 Hmong people in the United States.

29
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:54,915
Most live in California and Minnesota.

30
00:03:55,815 --> 00:04:06,299
The Hmong community came to the US as refugees in the late 1970s, mostly from Laos, at the end of the Vietnam War.

31
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Lee’s victory caused widespread celebration in Minnesota.

32
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,490
The state’s governor, Tim Walz, and St.

33
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:22,510
Paul Mayor Melvin Carter declared Friday “Sunisa Lee Day”.

34
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:31,990
Lee’s parents and family members joined a huge crowd of supporters in Minnesota Thursday to watch Lee compete.

35
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,080
Her family could not travel to Tokyo because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

36
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:54,870
Her father, John Lee, told the AP, “I can’t find the words to express how happy we are, how important that was to me and my family and to the whole Hmong community throughout the world”.

37
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,969
He added, “We never expected gold, but she came through.

38
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,900
She did it”.

39
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:10,905
Lee Pao Xiong is director of the Center for Hmong Studies at Concordia University in St paul, Minnesota.

40
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:15,225
He said Lee represents a special kind of American.

41
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:29,914
“You have the child of a refugee representing the United States of America, so not only representing America, but bringing the spotlight to the Hmong community,” Xiong said.

42
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:41,445
“Even for her to be so proud to say I’m doing this for my community, I’m doing this for my people, she didn’t forget her Hmong-ness”.

43
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:43,414
I’m Susan Shand.
