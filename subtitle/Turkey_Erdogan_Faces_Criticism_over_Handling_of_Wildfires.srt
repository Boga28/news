00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,960
Extremely powerful fires have destroyed villages and forests in Turkey over the past week.

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:21,780
Critics have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government of being slow to act and lacking readiness for large fires.

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:32,445
The fires in Turkey’s Turquoise Coast began Wednesday and have been made worse with strong winds and hot temperatures.

4
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:38,685
They have left eight people dead and forced thousands to leave their homes.

5
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:43,545
Some villagers have lost farmland and animals.

6
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:55,575
Firefighters on Tuesday were still fighting nine fires in the coastal parts of Antalya and Mugla that are popular tourist areas.

7
00:00:57,254 --> 00:01:02,455
Other fires were reported in the areas of Adana and Isparta.

8
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:11,595
Officials said 137 fires in 30 provinces have been put out since Wednesday.

9
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:18,975
A senior Turkish forestry official spoke to The Associated Press about the crisis.

10
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:24,405
He said the forest fires were the worst in Turkey in recent years.

11
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:32,705
He did not know how much land the fires had destroyed or how long it would take to put them out.

12
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:40,685
But he did say that strong winds were restarting fires that had been brought under control.

13
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:51,215
As people lost their homes and land, anger turned toward the government, who admitted they do not have enough firefighting airplanes.

14
00:01:53,005 --> 00:02:04,155
Opposition parties have accused the government of failing to buy enough of the planes, and using the money for building projects that hurt the environment.

15
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:09,945
In the village of Bozalan, homes and farms were burned down.

16
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:14,535
Some people there were were very unhappy with the government response.

17
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:24,825
Thirty-year-old Nevzat Yildirim said he had called officials asking for help but “nothing came”.

18
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:32,685
“We tried to protect our own homes through our own means, by filling up buckets,” he said.

19
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:43,095
Erdogan’s government has also been accused of hurting firefighting efforts by refusing help from Western countries, like Greece.

20
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:55,934
Agriculture and Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli denied that accusation, and said Greece only offered small firefighting planes.

21
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:02,265
The Israeli Embassy said Tuesday that Israel had also offered to help.

22
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:09,765
But Turkish officials refused the offer, saying the “situation is under control”.

23
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:15,685
The Israeli Embassy said the offer for help is still available.

24
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:24,265
Firefighting planes have come from foreign countries including Spain, Croatia, Russia and Iran.

25
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:34,445
A total of 16 planes, 51 helicopters and more than 5,000 workers were fighting the fires, officials said.

26
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:41,180
Erdogan visited the fire-effected Antalya area over the weekend.

27
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,790
But he was criticized for insensitivity after throwing bags of tea at people from his bus.

28
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,490
Officials have started investigations into the cause of the fires.

29
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Officials said Kurdish militants could have started the flames.

30
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:09,305
Experts, however, mostly blame climate change as the cause, along with accidents by people.

31
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:16,805
A heat wave has spread in southern Europe and has led to wildfires across the Mediterranean.

32
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:28,995
Italian firefighters have fought more than 37,000 fires since June 15, a 76 percent increase over last year.

33
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:43,234
The Turkish weather service said temperatures would rise this week between 4 and 8 degrees Celsius above normal around the country’s Aegean and Mediterranean coasts.
