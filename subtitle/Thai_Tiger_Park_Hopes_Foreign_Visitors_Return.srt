A tiger park in Phuket, Thailand is preparing to welcome back foreign visitors this week.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:19,980
The re-opening is part of a plan to bring back foreign visitors with proof of  COVID-19 vaccination to the island.

3
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,540
The visitors do not have to follow lockdown restrictions.

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:35,100
After 14 days, as long as they have no coronavirus infection, they can travel elsewhere in Thailand.

5
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:43,290
Chadarat Taodaeng is the general manager of Tiger Kingdom in Phuket.

6
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:52,970
He said the park had put safety measures in place before Thursday‛s reopening to help foreign visitors feel comfortable.

7
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:06,384
“We have vaccinated more than 90 percent of our staff and also trained them about the ‛new normal‛ tourism,” the manager said.

8
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:12,535
The park has more than 50 tigers and a cheetah.

9
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,535
And visitors can get close to them.

10
00:01:16,495 --> 00:01:27,225
Since the pandemic lockdowns, visitor numbers have dropped from nearly 1,000 a day to fewer than 20.

11
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:40,695
Thailand lost about $50 billion in tourism money when foreign arrivals fell to 6,7 million last year.

12
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:46,965
In 2019, the country had nearly 40 million visitors.

13
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:55,365
And Phuket suffered from a large number of job losses and business closings.

14
00:01:57,225 --> 00:02:11,765
“I‛m happy that finally there will be people visiting the tigers, and Phuket city will be bustling again,” said the park‛s assistant manager,  Phonphawit Ton-od.

15
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:21,690
She added that the reopening would“help with both tigers‛ and the staff‛s mental health”.

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:32,970
There has been an increase in the popularity of parks like the Tiger Kingdom, even though conservationists criticize them.

17
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:40,209
There are concerns over safety after some attacks by the animals.

18
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:46,415
Bringing back visitors is important to Thailand’s economy.

19
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:55,805
But government officials also have to deal with a recent increase in coronavirus infections.

20
00:02:57,395 --> 00:03:08,735
The government hopes Phuket‛s pilot program will bring 129,000 visitors to Thailand from July through September.

21
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:17,610
That number is still far below the average 3,3 million monthly arrivals in 2019.

22
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,720
Abdulrahim A-waekechi cares for the animals in the park.

23
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:37,930
He said,“I‛m happy about the park reopening because our cheetah Gregor loves being around tourists and staff”.

24
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,559
I’m Dan Friedel.
