1
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:15,855
That's Israel firing missiles into Northern Gaza as Hamas fires over 45 rockets aimed towards Jerusalem.

2
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:18,465
This is according to new reporting out from the IDF.

3
00:00:18,465 --> 00:00:19,875
That's the Israeli defense force.

4
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:21,225
It comes as tensions.

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,415
Continue to ratch up in the region.

6
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:32,055
Following what has been a week's long new spate of military conflict Trey Gates joins us now from Israel with details on the ground.

7
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:32,655
Hi Trey.

8
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:36,605
Jillian good afternoon.

9
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:39,845
This was a red line for Israel firing on Jerusalem.

10
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:48,275
Earlier this evening, seven rockets targeted the city and dozens of rockets have targeted communities along the Gaza border here where we are standing.

11
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:50,375
The past 30 minutes have been quiet.

12
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,945
But the IDF, the Israeli defense forces are preparing.

13
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:57,025
They say four days of fighting along the Gaza border.

14
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:04,885
If we spoke earlier with sources inside Gaza who have confirmed that the Israelis are now responding with airstrikes inside the Gaza strip.

15
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:08,995
According to the Palestinian health ministry, nine Gazans have been killed, including.

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,230
Three children in this Israeli, retaliation.

17
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,400
How did we get here?

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,720
That's the big question?

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,730
Well, this week has been extremely tense.

20
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:30,590
There were protests across Jerusalem that turned to riots early this morning, more than 300 Palestinians were injured at the Al-Aqsa mosque as Israeli security forces stormed in all of this related to two major issues.

21
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,810
Having to do with access to a Locksa and also the shake Jarrod neighborhood in Jerusalem.

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,649
Those are very local and focused issues for this conflict.

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,490
But as we have seen tonight, this is evolving into a much larger situation.

24
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:49,820
I want to get just some information that we're getting here from the Israeli military, they are calling this a severe assault on Israel.

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,289
They say they hold Hamas.

26
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,699
The group in control of Gaza, responsible saying Hamas will bear the consequences.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,080
We also know according to the Israeli defense spokesperson that.

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,350
A Hamas military commander was targeted in some of this Israeli retaliation this hour.

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,520
And this takes things to a different level inside Gaza because the factions there then say they need to respond.

30
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,740
There are two big factions inside Gaza.

31
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,110
One is Hamas and the other is Islamic jihad.

32
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:25,100
Both of them have fired rockets tonight into Southern Israel and central Israel in the past, the last major round.

33
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,615
Only focused on Islamic jihad.

34
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:33,975
So the fact that Hamas is getting involved in the fight means that this is turning into a serious conflict for the region.

35
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:39,285
And as you can see behind me, police have blocked off roads leading to the Gaza border itself.

36
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:44,655
We're just about a mile away from the border and there are bomb shelters opened all around us.

37
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:49,545
It's very quiet in this city of stood up because people are preparing for further conflict.

38
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:50,915
Trey.

39
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,295
Thanks for being there for us.

40
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:53,015
Stay safe.

41
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,125
We'll check back in with you later.

42
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:54,785
Appreciate it.
