1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,610
Nikolas Grafakos makes a special spoon.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,620
The spoon is for astronauts.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,390
The spoon helps astronauts eat more easily.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,770
It will be important during long trips to Mars.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,150
Astronauts use normal spoons now.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,770
The spoons are a little longer.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,629
It is not always easy to eat with them at zero gravity.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,570
The food must be wet.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,930
Then it sticks to the spoon.

10
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:45,040
The new spoon is very different.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,019
It is something between a spoon and chopsticks.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,450
You hold it in your hand.

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,120
You press it at the end.

14
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:58,995
The food stays on the spoon.

15
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:04,275
It is easier to put food in your mouth.

16
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:09,375
It will be possible to eat more kinds of food.

17
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,675
Astronauts will be happier.
