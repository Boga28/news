00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:16,410
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:16,980
I’m Neil.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,150
And I’m Georgina.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:27,090
In this programme we’re going to be talking about the astronaut who piloted the command module to take Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the Moon.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,410
Michael Collins, who sadly passed away in 2021 at the age of 90, has been described as ‘the loneliest man in history’.

6
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:51,460
Yes, while Armstrong delivered his famous quote when taking the first steps on the lunar surface, and Buzz followed soon after, Collins was left behind to circle the Moon, tasked with the huge responsibility of getting the three pioneers – the first people to do something - back to Earth.

7
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,560
That’s right – And many people over the years have wondered whether he was disappointed not to have walked on the Moon.

8
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,360
How would you feel if you went all that way and didn’t stand on the Moon, Georgina?.

9
00:01:02,745 --> 00:01:08,685
Me personally – I’d probably be pretty devastated – but I think it depends on personality.

10
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:12,585
To be honest, I’d probably be too scared to go to the Moon anyway.

11
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:24,045
Yes – and just think about being in a space module together – trapped for all those hours – it could create quite the sense of camaraderie – a friendship and trust formed by spending time together.

12
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:27,604
Or you could drive each other crazy asking questions!.

13
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:30,735
Which is what I’m going to do now, Georgina.

14
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:39,425
I know how much you love animals – and the first animal that went into space was a Russian dog in 1957, but what was that dog’s name?.

15
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:41,094
A) Irina.

16
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:42,774
B) Laika or.

17
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:43,934
C) Anastasia.

18
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:49,645
Well, I think I know this one - b) Laika - and I believe, sadly, she didn’t survive.

19
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:53,535
OK, Georgina, we’ll find out if that’s right at the end of the programme.

20
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:59,505
But let’s talk more  about Michael Collins and that famous trip to the Moon that captured people’s attention around the world.

21
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:09,285
Yes - I think one thing that has always interested me is the feeling of friendship, or as you said camaraderie, that must have developed between those three explorers.

22
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:18,765
But, perhaps surprisingly, in an interview with the BBC programme Hard Talk, Collins said the close connection between the astronauts didn't develop until later.

23
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:32,160
We formed some very strong bonds, but actually, not really during the flight of Apollo 11 or even during the preparatory flight of the flight.

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,390
It was a round-the-world trip that we took after the flight.

25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,700
When I came to know Neil better.

26
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:56,645
During our training, in the first place we had not been a backup as most primary crews had been, so we just got to know each other in the 6 months before the flight, which is a short period of time.

27
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:08,065
So, it wasn’t really until afterwards that they formed those strong bonds – the connections between them, until on a trip round the world to talk about their experiences.

28
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:18,725
Six months sounds like a long time, but I suppose when preparing to become famous and go down in history, as they did - it doesn’t leave much time for personal interactions.

29
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:26,585
One of the sad things to take away is that everyone remembers Armstrong and Aldrin, but sometimes Collins is seen as the forgotten man.

30
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:37,470
Yes – and he did say in the interview that he would have loved to walk on the Moon, but he was very proud to be a part of the team – as he was one of the trailblazers – a similar word to pioneer.

31
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,829
They most certainly were trailblazers.

32
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:43,910
But imagine how he must have felt – circling around Moon, all alone!.

33
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:52,899
Yes, a lot of people questioned Collins afterwards regarding the solitude, about which he had this to say in the same interview with BBC programme Hard Talk:.

34
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:08,280
Well, I, when I returned to Earth, I was amazed because most of the questions to me from the press centred on: You were the loneliest man in the whole lonely orbit around the lonely planet on a lonely evening.

35
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,740
And I felt, on the other hand, quite comfortable in my happy little home inside the command module Columbia.

36
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,780
I had been flying aeroplanes by myself for a number of years.

37
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,670
So, the fact I was aloft by myself was not anything new.

38
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,110
So, it sounds like he appreciated the peace and quiet and he felt used to it having been alone on flights.

39
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:44,940
Yes – while people talk about the two who walked on the Moon, he must have experienced an incredible sense of peace while on the dark side of the Moon – the first person ever to go there.

40
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,160
But now, Georgina, let’s get the answer to my question: What was the name of the first animal, a dog, to go into space?.

41
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,750
I said Laika.

42
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,950
Which is correct, well done!.

43
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,309
And you were right when you said that she sadly didn’t survive the return to Earth.

44
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,830
Well, speaking of dogs, I need to feed mine soon - so let’s just recap some of the vocabulary we’ve discussed.

45
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:15,920
Yes, we had camaraderie – a sense of trust and friendship after spending a long time together, and the creation of strong bonds or connections.

46
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,239
And if you’re the first person to do something, you could be called a pioneer.

47
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,205
Or even a trailblazer which means the same thing.

48
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:28,435
And if you are the first person to do something, you could become famous and go down in history.

49
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:34,805
And finally we spoke about the solitude, or state of being alone, that Collins must have experienced.

50
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:37,175
Well, we’re out of time for today.
