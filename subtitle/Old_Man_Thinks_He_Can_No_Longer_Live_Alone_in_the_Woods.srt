00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,930
A man’s days living alone in the forest in the state of New Hampshire appear to be over.

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:16,210
David Lidstone said he does not think he can return to his old way of living.

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,940
The decision came after the cabin he lived in burned down not long ago.

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,410
Lidstone is also known as “River Dave”.

5
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:36,045
He had been living for 27 years in the area, but was ordered to leave in a recent court case.

6
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:51,644
In a discussion with The Associated Press (AP), Lidstone used the term hermit - a person who lives in a simple way apart from others – to describe how he used to live.

7
00:00:52,919 --> 00:01:03,239
“I don’t see how I can go back to being a hermit because society is not going to allow it,” Lidstone, age 81, said.

8
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:13,050
Lidstone cut his firewood and grew his food in the woods along the Merrimack River in the town of Canterbury.

9
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:22,475
He built the cabin with his wife, from whom he is now separated, although he said they are still married.

10
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:29,555
He said he is not too sad about the loss of his life in isolation.

11
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:40,865
“Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life,” said Lidstone, who is not close with his family.

12
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:46,185
Lidstone did not want to say anything more about his family.

13
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:55,305
Two of his three sons had told the AP that they had not been in touch with their father recently.

14
00:01:56,415 --> 00:02:01,305
His daughter did not respond to a message asking for a comment.

15
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:10,485
On July 15, Lidstone was jailed and told he would be released if he agreed to leave the cabin.

16
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:17,775
The action followed a land dispute that goes back to 2016.

17
00:02:18,735 --> 00:02:28,425
The landowner, 86-year-old Leonard Giles, of South Burlington, Vermont, wanted Lidstone off his land.

18
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:34,415
The land is undeveloped and mostly used for wood cutting.

19
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:39,585
It has been owned by the same family since 1963.

20
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:48,560
Lidstone had said an earlier owner in the family gave his word years ago that he could live there.

21
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,640
But Lidstone had no written agreement.

22
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,850
He later disputed that he was even on the land owned by the family.

23
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:09,860
In a recent court case, both sides agreed to allow Lidstone to collect his cats and chickens and remaining possessions.

24
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,500
Some items had been given to police to keep safe.

25
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:29,050
Lidstone, who still believes he was not on Giles’ land, also was given permission to hire a surveyor to give him “peace of mind,” Judge Andrew Schulman said.

26
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,690
A fire destroyed the cabin on August 4.

27
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,890
The fire happened hours after Lidstone defended himself during a court hearing.

28
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:53,609
He was released from jail the next day after the judge ruled that he would have less reason to return to “this particular place in the woods”.

29
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:05,220
Canterbury Fire Chief Michael Gamache said that while the investigation is not over, the fire was likely caused by accident.

30
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,730
“Right now, there’s nothing left to go on at the site,” Gamache said.

31
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,380
Meanwhile, many people across the United States and in other countries have offered to help Lidstone.

32
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,880
They have offered to help raise money or offered him a place to live.

33
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,780
Lidstone said he is thankful for all the support.

34
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,340
He is still trying to decide where he will go next.

35
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:44,110
He would not mind staying in New Hampshire, where he has developed some strong connections.

36
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,630
I’m John Russell.
