00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:09,210
Traditional wooden boats, known as caique or kaiki, are an important part of Greek culture.

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:18,830
They have been used for centuries to fish and to transport goods, animals, and people.

3
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,490
They are seen everywhere in printed materials for visitors and holiday pictures.

4
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:34,995
But the art of designing and building these wooden boats, completely by hand, is under threat.

5
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:47,834
To build a “caique,” one person has to do all the work from cutting down trees and moving the wood, to securing each piece in place.

6
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:55,485
The tradition is passed on from father to son or from one family member to another.

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:08,110
Now, fewer people are ordering wooden boats since boats made from materials like plastic and fiberglass are less costly to maintain.

8
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:18,580
And young people are not as interested in joining a profession that requires years of learning with an uncertain future.

9
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,860
Giorgos Kiassos is one of the last remaining boat builders on the Greek island Samos.

10
00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:31,185
It was once a major boat production center.

11
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:39,495
Kiassos is currently building two boats, one for pleasure and the other for fishing.

12
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:50,085
While working, he said, “If something doesn’t change, there will come a time when there won’t be anyone left doing this type of job.”

13
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:56,250
“Unfortunately, I see the profession slowly dying,” he added.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,940
The boats are being made to order.

15
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,880
The bigger one costs $70,000 and the smaller one is around $35,000.

16
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,880
Caiques from Samos island are famous for both the quality of the work and the material.

17
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:26,890
The wood is taken from a kind of pine tree that is stronger and more resistant to insects.

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,140
Years ago, there were many boat-building centers on the island.

19
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,780
They employed many people and supported whole communities.

20
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,650
Now, there are only about four left.

21
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,455
Kiassos said caique building is an art but the work is tough and tiring.

22
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:54,375
He said young people are not following the profession.

23
00:02:55,305 --> 00:03:04,005
He tried to get his 23-year-old son to learn, but his son hopes to become a boat captain instead.

24
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:14,245
Kostas Damianidis is an architect with a doctorate, or Ph D, in Greek traditional boatbuilding.

25
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,320
He said there are many reasons for the fast decrease of traditional boat boatbuilders in Greece.

26
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:37,210
He said, “It is a traditional craft which is slowly dying, and yet it’s treated as if it were a simple manufacturing or supply business.

27
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,900
There is no support from the state.”

28
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:55,590
On top of that, for years the European Union, of which Greece is a member, has supported destroying these boats as a way of reducing the country’s fishing fleet.

29
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:05,920
Damianidis questioned why a young person would want to learn the craft if the government is destroying the boats.

30
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:16,260
Another major reason for the fast-shrinking number of shipbuilders is the lack of any official learning process.

31
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:32,400
Damianidis said, “Young people have to go learn beside the old craftsmen, often for five years, six years, for them to be able to make a small boat, a kaiki, themselves”.

32
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:37,875
He added, “There is no boatbuilding school.”

33
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:47,295
Damiandis is setting up a new museum of Aegean Boatbuilding and Maritime Crafts on Samos.

34
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:55,784
He hopes a traditional boatbuilding school, which would be Greece’s first, will open in the museum.

35
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:06,270
That could also help the boatbuilders on Samos who now work mainly alone due to a shortage of skilled assistants.

36
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,090
“It’s important to have someone experienced because if you make one mistake,.

37
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:21,010
The boat might end up being — well, more of a basin than a boat,” Kiassos said laughing.

38
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:36,615
After working for more than 30 years, Kiassos has learned the right time to cut down a tree, when to use naturally curved wood, and where on the boat each piece should go.

39
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:43,245
He explained if you get that wrong, the boat could end up with problems.

40
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:49,815
Get it right, and his creation combines beauty, strength, and purpose.

41
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:57,100
Kiassos says he is ready to finish each boat and start on the next.

42
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,060
“But when it leaves, I’m somehow sad.

43
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:12,580
Yes, I’ll be happy when I see it in the water and I see everything is OK, but it’s like something is leaving — like a piece of me.”

44
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,520
I’m Caty Weaver.

45
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,020
And I'm Gregory Stachel.
