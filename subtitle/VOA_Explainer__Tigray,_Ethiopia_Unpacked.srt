3
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:33,965

13
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:50,480
Then at the gray, an ex fighter Mellison ally led the new coalition government in 1991 that instituted a system known as ethnic federalism.

14
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:01,300

00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:14,445
He dissolved the ruling party, the EPA RDF, and created the prosperity.

The central government called the elections illegal.

25
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:47,765
The rift grew in October when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with the TPLF to Grise administration said this amounted to a declaration of war.

36
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,150
As access to parts of the Tigray region is still restricted.

37
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,690
The UN and other organizations say some people have died of starvation and many more are at risk.
