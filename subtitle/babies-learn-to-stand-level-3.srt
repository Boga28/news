Since 1990, an Icelandic doctor has been teaching young babies to stand and balance.

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:16,020
As a demonstration, he stood in a pool and held one baby up on his hand, and the baby managed to stand without falling.

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,990
His simple techniques are to strengthen their spines and upper bodies and this puzzles a few doctors.

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:39,480
Another doctor said that he has no idea how the doctor does this and it is not logical or normal, as babies usually learn to stand by leaning on a chair at seven to eight months old, difficult words: puzzle (confuse).
