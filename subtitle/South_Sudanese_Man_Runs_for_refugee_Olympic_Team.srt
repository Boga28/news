00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,660
South Sudanese runner Paulo Amotun Lokoro is among a group 29 athletes named to the International Olympic Committee’s Refugee Olympic Team.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,185
He will compete in the Summer Games in Tokyo from July 23 to August 8.

3
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:31,110
Lokoro fled conflict in South Sudan and joined others at the large Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya in 2006.

4
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,190
He did not know at the time that he would soon take part in international sports.

5
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:47,550
Lokoro became interested in the Olympics when he was urged to compete in a 2015 marathon at Kakuma.

6
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:59,045
The event was organized by the United Nations’ refugee agency and Kenya's Tegla Loroupe.

7
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:07,875
Loroupe was the first African woman to win a major marathon,  beginning with the New York City marathon in 1994.

8
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:14,565
Lokoro said of the Kakuma marathon, “I didn’t know I would go far.

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,095
I was just running.

10
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:19,440
We went to the field and jogged.

11
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,970
I didn’t have the psychology of being in front or behind.

12
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,800
My aim was to just follow the people going in front of me.

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,420
I found some guys were tired, and then I led them.”

14
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:42,180
Lokoro competed in the Rio Olympics in August 2016 as a runner in the 1500 meter-event.

15
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:55,824
Returning Olympians on the refugee team include South Sudanese runners Anjelina Nadai Lohalith, James Nyang Chiengjiek and Rose Nathike Likonyen.

16
00:01:57,335 --> 00:02:06,695
Others include swimmer Yusra Mardini from Syria and judo athlete Popole Misenga from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

17
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:17,665
Another South Sudanese runner, Matthew Lam Joar, will return to the Refugee Olympic Team as an assistant to the coaching staff.

18
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:24,095
He wants to share his experiences with other refugees.

19
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:32,244
“I will be cheering for my team – a team that I was part of and still [am] part of,” he said.

20
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:38,494
“We believe they are the best guys because they have the courage to start running.

21
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:44,045
They are world class, running with the best in the world.”

22
00:02:45,935 --> 00:03:01,235
In June, IOC President Thomas Bach said it was important to have refugees join with other Olympic athletes to “send a powerful message of solidarity, resilience and hope to the world.”

23
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:10,650
Lokoro said he hopes to one day compete for South Sudan in international competitions such as the Olympics.

24
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:20,609
“One day, one time, if my country settles down, maybe I will go back and represent my country,” he said.

25
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:33,630
The 29 refugees competing in the Tokyo Games are from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Eritrea.

26
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,670
Others are from Iraq, Syria, Venezuela, South Sudan and Sudan.

27
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,910
I’m Jonathan Evans.
