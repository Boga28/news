00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,710
In much of the United States, people can get married at the age of 16 if they have parental permission.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,720
However, in 13 states, even younger people can get married under some conditions.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:27,660
In North Carolina, children as young as 14 used to be able to get married if they were pregnant and had a judge’s permission.

4
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:37,620
As a result, the state was a known place to go if you were an adult who wanted to marry a child.

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:49,440
But North Carolina lawmakers recently passed a bill that changes the legal marriage age from 14 to 16.

6
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,940
The law now goes to the state’s Governor, Roy Cooper, for final approval.

7
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,880
He is expected to sign it.

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:11,120
The new law also limits the permissible age difference between a 16-year-old and their marriage partner to four years.

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:20,030
This year, state lawmakers listened to the stories of several former child brides.

10
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:32,205
One of them, Judy Wiegand of Kentucky, appeared before a North Carolina House committee in June to support the reform.

11
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:41,625
“It is the responsibility of the government to protect all of the children,” Wiegand told lawmakers.

12
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:51,015
Wiegand was 13 when she and an older teenage boy — the father of her baby — married in the 1970s.

13
00:01:52,275 --> 00:02:00,585
She said that until she became an adult, the law left her largely unprotected against an abusive husband.

14
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:05,355
Jean Fields is 72 years old.

15
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:10,285
She got married at the age of 15 to a man in his 20s.

16
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:15,885
Fields had three children by the time she was 21.

17
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:24,915
She later separated from her husband who, she said, had abused her psychologically for years.

18
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:36,255
Groups working to persuade lawmakers to change the marriage age in North Carolina say there are more women with similar stories.

19
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:43,455
Those women, however, are uncomfortable talking in public about their experiences.

20
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,330
Two of those groups are Unchained at Last and the International Center for Research on Women.

21
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:02,050
They are trying to get states around the US to change the marriage age to 18, with no exceptions.

22
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,600
So far, six states have that rule in place.

23
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,910
New York was the most recent, where the rule became law in July.

24
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:29,095
A Center study shows an estimated 8,800 girls under the age of 18 were listed on marriage records in North Carolina between 2000 and 2015.

25
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:38,105
The group said that 93 percent of the marriage applications it looked at involved a marriage between a child and an adult.

26
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:55,795
While many lawmakers wanted to change the marriage age to 18 in North Carolina, a spokeswoman for the Governor said raising the age to 16 is an important step toward ending child marriage in the state.

27
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:06,295
In one North Carolina county, two-thirds of all marriage permission requests involving people younger than 18 came from other states.

28
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:16,500
People who live in nearby Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and South Carolina come to get married in North Carolina.

29
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,680
Drew Reisinger is the Register of Deeds in Buncombe County.

30
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,320
He is an elected official who writes documents that permit people to get married.

31
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:36,945
He said a 49-year-old man from Kentucky recently came with a 17-year-old girl.

32
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:50,295
With the new law, he said, North Carolina will no longer be “at the very bottom of the barrel of states, but we’re still going to be putting a lot of children in harm’s way”.

33
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:52,585
