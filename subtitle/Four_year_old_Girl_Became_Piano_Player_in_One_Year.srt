00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:12,690
At just four years of age, Brigitte Xie has already won a place to perform piano at New York City’s Carnegie Hall.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,400
The young girl also can read music.

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,160
She can even play a piece of classical music from Beethoven.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,390
It is called “Sonatina in F Major”.

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,685
Brigitte's feet hang above the floor when the small girl sits on the piano seat.

6
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:41,685
Her hands move spiritedly across the piano keys.

7
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:53,055
She shyly looked down when her mother, Nicole Sun, asked if she likes piano and if it is fun.

8
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,825
"Yeah, fun," Brigitte replied.

9
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:03,230
The young girl wears her long brown hair tied back.

10
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:16,330
Brigitte's father, Tao Xie of Ridgefield, Connecticut, signed her up for online piano classes on Zoom about a year ago.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:28,574
The video conferencing program become a popular way to attend all kinds of classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

12
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:38,975
Tao bought the lessons to give his daughter something to do after officials ordered people to stay at home.

13
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:47,535
"At the beginning, I never expected that she's going to be a prodigy or anything," he said.

14
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:52,065
But he was happily surprised that it happened.

15
00:01:53,384 --> 00:02:01,395
Brigitte is the youngest winner of the well-respected Elite International Music Competition.

16
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:07,965
That win earned her the chance to perform at Carnegie Hall.

17
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:22,725
In November 2020, she was supposed to play there as part of a competition called the American Protégé International Music Talent Competition.

18
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:36,965
But it got delayed to this November and now to November 2022 because of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

19
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:45,235
Brigitte's mother gives credit to her piano teacher, Felicia Feng Zhang.

20
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:54,240
"Brigitte came to me when she was just two months after three years old," her teacher said.

21
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,650
"From the lessons, I observed she has a curious mind and she loves to learn.

22
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,140
We call that passion".

23
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:14,190
She added that, during the lessons, the girl’s “big eyes really, really watch me and how I demonstrate”.

24
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:23,630
She says Brigitte’s concentration level is really high and continues to improve.

25
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,890
And, she follows directions very well.

26
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:37,670
Nicole Sun says her daughter may have more skill and interest in music than other children.

27
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,470
But the most important thing is that they found Felicia.

28
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:53,174
“Yeah, we are really lucky to have met her and have her as Brigitte’s first piano teacher,” she said.

29
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:55,660
I’m Alice Bryant.
