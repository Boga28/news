1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,130
To be a historic action to protect Asian-Americans in this country and made that dramatic rise in attacks.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,970
President Biden‛s signing into law and anti-Asian hate crimes bill.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,190
It was overwhelmingly approved by Congress.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,050
And tonight here, that horrific case in New York city, a woman assaulted in broad daylight.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:25,260
You‛ll remember us reporting here, bystanders appearing to watch it unfold, but doing nothing about it tonight, ABCs, Juju Chang with the survivor of that attack.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,270
Tonight, the woman who survived this brutal attack on a New York city street.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:39,710
Now speaking out about the trauma, she endured that day, physically I‛m healing well, but mentally, emotionally, I‛m not there yet.

8
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,850
Surveillance video showing 66 year old Vilma carry a Filipino American on our way to church.

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,600
When a man suddenly kicks her, knocking her down stomping on her face repeatedly.

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,290
Film, his daughter says the attacker hurled racist slurs at her mom F you Asian, you don‛t belong here.

11
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,440
The suspect a homeless man, reportedly with a history of mental illness arrested on hate crime charges.

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,000
He pleaded not guilty.

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:20,510
What does justice at the end of the day look like for you？ It‛s time to change the law so that those victims of hate crime should have a voice and should have, um, justice.

14
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:29,945
In court today, president Biden‛s signing the COVID-19 hate crimes act every time we‛re silent.

15
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:37,085
Every time we let hate flourish, you make a lot.

16
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:39,075
Who we are as a nation.

17
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:56,645
It‛s that silence that Vilma and her daughter are determined to break sharing AAPI stories, flipping the attackers, alleged words to say, AAP, we do belong here and take that power away from that person that decided to inflict this horrible act on my mom.

18
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:02,375
So brave of Velma to share her story with you, Juju your reporting has been so powerful on all of this for many months.

19
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,315
Now, you and I were on the air for the attacks in Atlanta.

20
00:02:05,345 --> 00:02:11,495
We know that eight died, six were of Asian descent, but this new bill put into law today will actually help.

21
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:13,505
So many of the other cases we hope.

22
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,244
That have not received the kind of attention that they deserve.

23
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:16,785
Absolutely.

24
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:28,625
As you know, a district attorney in Georgia announced hate crime charges against that alleged shooter in Atlanta, but hate crime charges like Vilmos are rare and today‛s new law is designed to make that process easier.

25
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:38,394
And David, while Vilma is interested in pursuing justice to the enth degree, she also prayed for her attacker and is literally fighting hate with love extraordinary.

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,590
And again, brave of Vilma to talk with you.

27
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,250
We‛re going to have much more of Juju‛s interview later tonight, right here on Nightline.

28
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,480
And we‛ll be watching thanks to you.

29
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,138
