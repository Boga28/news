00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:12,270
Four former police officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota last year are to face a federal civil rights trial.

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:24,510
A federal grand jury has decided to bring charges against the four accusing them of violating George Floyd’s constitutional rights.

3
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:34,935
A grand jury is a group of citizens who study evidence to decide if there should be a trial in a legal case.

4
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,435
The decision was made public Friday.

5
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:50,325
Floyd died after officers restrained him on the ground during his arrest on May 25, 2020.

6
00:00:51,614 --> 00:01:02,295
During the arrest, Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe in an incident which was filmed and shown all over the world.

7
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:13,455
Derek Chauvin is charged with violating Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force.

8
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:25,140
Tou Thao and J alexander Keung are also charged with violating Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure.

9
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:36,150
The charging document alleges that the two did not try to stop Chauvin as he put a knee on Floyd’s neck.

10
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:49,050
All four officers, Chauvin, Keung, Thao, and Thomas Lane, are charged with failure to provide Floyd with medical care.

11
00:01:50,960 --> 00:02:01,025
Chauvin is also charged in connection with the arrest and restraint of a 14-year-old boy in 2017.

12
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:14,609
Three of the former officers, Lane, Thao and Keung, appeared before the US district Court in Minneapolis through a video link.

13
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:18,769
Chauvin was not part of the court appearance.

14
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:31,050
In April, a court in Minneapolis found Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter charges brought by the state of Minnesota.

15
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:42,060
He is being held in a high security prison in the state as he waits for his sentence to be decided by a judge.

16
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:53,595
The three former officers named by the federal grand jury also face state charges in a trial planned for August.

17
00:02:54,495 --> 00:03:00,555
They are free after paying a bond to ensure that they appear for trial.

18
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:07,334
The charges are the result of the arrest of Floyd last year.

19
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:18,285
The officers stopped Floyd after he was accused of trying to use false money at a store and acting unusually.

20
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:24,465
Court evidence states that Floyd resisted being arrested.

21
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:33,495
Chauvin then restrained Floyd on the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes.

22
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:45,345
State lawyers say that Kueng placed his knee on Floyd’s back and Lane held down Floyd’s legs during the arrest.

23
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:57,045
The state lawyers also say Thao held a gathering crowd back and prevented them from intervening in the arrest.

24
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:08,615
Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s lawyer argued during his murder that the former officer acted reasonably in the situation.

25
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:17,580
He said that Floyd died of existing health problems and was using drugs at the time.

26
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,260
He also requested a new trial for Chauvin noting several issues.

27
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:38,280
Among the issues was that the judge did not move the trial to another place although the incident caused violent protests in Minneapolis.

28
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,280
Floyd’s arrest was captured on video by many people who gathered around the arrest.

29
00:04:48,900 --> 00:05:02,789
The incident brought public anger and protests, both peaceful and violent, across the country against police use of force and racial inequality.

00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,375
