1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,140
China has announced a major shift in its family planning policy.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,140
It will now allow couples to have up to three children.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:15,870
The ruling communist party says it is scrapping a strict two child policy in response to the rapidly rising number of older people in the population.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,000
Beijing has enforced birth limits for four decades, but it‛s now concerned that a demographic crisis could add to pressure on its economy.

5
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:30,435
And from one of the story let‛s bring in correspondent, Mathias, Berlinger, who‛s standing by in Beijing.

6
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:31,035
Hi Mathias.

7
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:31,905
It‛s good to see you.

8
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:35,415
So tell us more about why China is enacting this policy now.

9
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:45,005
Well, a few weeks ago, uh, the results of the latest census came out.

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:49,115
China is counting its population every 10 years.

11
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:53,585
And, uh, this, these results had to be delayed several times.

12
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:59,735
Uh, nobody really knows why, but there has been a lot of speculation that China might have reached.

13
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:03,540
It‛s peak, uh, population peak already.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,509
The census data, the officials said, no, that‛s not the case, but it is not far away.

15
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,730
It will happen in the next two weeks or three years.

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:26,720
And then the population will decline and China will be facing the same problems that many developed countries face an aging population, less workforce, but being on a development level and an income level that is much lower than these countries.

17
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,860
And that could spell out.

18
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:27,950
Yeah.

19
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,530
Big problems for China.

20
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,220
This is why it is a big concern to the government.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:41,620
This aging population last year was the year with the lowest birth rates, uh, in China‛s history.

22
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,780
It was 1,2 children per women, quite far from the three children they‛re aiming at now.

23
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,110
Yeah.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,340
You said it then, you know, there are many other countries facing this issue.

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,910
So how serious is China as a demographic crisis?.

26
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:57,240
Yeah.

27
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:06,470
Well, the problem is that China has not reached the development levels and the income levels that other countries had reached when they started facing this problem.

28
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:21,460
So, uh, basically, uh, having to feed, uh, a retired population that is, uh, So big, but with these income levels will be much more difficult than if the income levels were higher.

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,020
The pension system is not very well developed, so it is a very big problem for China.

30
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,280
So China‛s now allowing couples to have up to three children.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,070
Do you think we‛re going to see a baby boom in the coming years?.

32
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:42,125
Yeah, four years ago, China lifted the ban on the second child and allow people to have two children.

33
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:45,125
There was a very small baby boom in the following lead.

34
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:45,365
Yeah.

35
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:57,645
Already the year after the birth rate started declining again, having reached their lowest point last year, the pandemic might‛ve played into this very low number as well, but the trend is clear.

36
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,265
The numbers are declining.

37
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:09,375
It is not very likely that this is going to change just because the government puts the number at three it‛s much easier to prevent people from having children than to encourage them.

38
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,920
China‛s government is finding out.

39
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,140
Now there are many reasons for that.

40
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,180
One reason is that, uh, the parents will have one now.

41
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:26,715
Thinking about family planning or maybe around 30 years old, they, many of them have never known families with two children.

42
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,695
This is the one child generation.

43
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:43,265
And the other thing is in the highly competitive education system, many prefer to put all their resources into one child in order to give them better chances in life, correspondent, Mathias, billing, a reporting from Beijing.

44
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,075
Thank you very much.
