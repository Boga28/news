00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:12,360
Ana Saul Romero has seen many changes in teaching methods, testing, and technology during her forty years as a teacher.

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,390
But this year, she said, has given her a lifetime’s worth of changes.

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:27,600
In her first-grade class in Manor, Texas, just outside of Austin, only 12 students are inside the classroom.

4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,400
The other half of the class join in from home by video.

5
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:43,680
Romero now stands behind a clear divider working with a pointer, a laptop, and a few other technologies to teach her students.

6
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:53,970
Romero said, “it is difficult with the technology, and I have learned more, but it is not enough, it is never enough.”

7
00:00:55,335 --> 00:01:02,325
She said she is from an older generation and she misses the daily, in-person connections with her students.

8
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:07,695
First-year teacher Cindy Hipps is Romero’s teaching partner.

9
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:12,645
She said it was like being “introduced to the ring of fire of teaching.”

10
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:17,145
She added, “I feel like a superwoman now.”

11
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:25,289
This spring marks a year since the coronavirus pandemic shut down schools across the United States.

12
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,860
It forced many students, parents, and teachers into virtual classrooms.

13
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,670
As states permitted larger groups to gather, some students have since returned to school.

14
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,570
Many schools now use a combination of virtual and in-person instruction in class.

15
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,380
And teachers like Romero have to learn new ways of teaching all the students.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Adding to the difficulties, not all students have equal access to internet and technology.

17
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,410
There were political and social protests across the country.

18
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:11,100
And many tired educators are wondering if this will be their last school year.

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,704
Antoinette Miranda is an Ohio State University professor of school psychology.

20
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:24,885
She is also on the state’s school board and is married to a high school teacher.

21
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:32,295
She said that educators are dealing with the pandemic’s effects on themselves and their family.

22
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:42,345
They also are trying to support students, some with troubles in school and some without food at home while being separated from friends.

23
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:51,675
“We talk a lot about the stress on students,” Miranda said, “but I think there’s a tremendous amount of stress on teachers.”

24
00:02:53,085 --> 00:03:00,615
Some people blamed teachers who raised concerns on health and safety for delaying school re-openings.

25
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:04,005
They felt it put pressure on parents.

26
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:09,375
But Miranda thinks “there’s also a renewed respect for teachers.

27
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,100
Especially parents that had to start teaching their kids at home.”

28
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,730
Andre Spencer is head of the Manor Independent School District where Romero works.

29
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,089
He said the schools centered on helping students and teachers during the pandemic.

30
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:37,589
They spent millions to provide every student and teacher the technology for virtual learning, including mobile internet access.

31
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:49,454
Even before the start of this school year, school supervisors like Spencer were already worried that there would be a shortage of teachers and school workers.

32
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:57,225
The National Education Association is one of the nation’s largest representatives for teachers.

33
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:08,985
The organization found that more than one in four teachers felt the pandemic increased their plans to retire early or leave the profession.

34
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:17,745
Randi Weingarten is president of American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, another teacher’s organization.

35
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:26,895
She believes there will be more teachers retiring in the coming months after a year of unknowns, change, and stress.

36
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:33,435
And AFT has started a program to help members who were affected by COVID-19.

37
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:40,305
But there were other issues that affect teachers, especially teachers of color, this past year.

38
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:50,085
They include national conversations around racial injustice, the presidential election, and the attack on the US Capitol.

39
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:55,604
Travis Bristol is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

40
00:04:56,925 --> 00:05:01,755
He suggests schools provide employees time to talk about what they have been through.

41
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:09,825
He says teachers who have been supported in dealing with their own stress will be better able to help students do the same.

42
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:15,615
Romero, the first-grade teacher in Texas, was considering retiring.

43
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,945
But she now looks forward to the new school year.

44
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:24,405
She said, “We will have the experience of an entire year of trying.

45
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,490
That’s what educators do.

46
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,550
We try and we fail and we get up and we shake it off and we do it again.”

47
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,040
I’m Jill Robbins.
