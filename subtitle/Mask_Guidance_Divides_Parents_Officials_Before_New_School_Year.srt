00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,210
US health officials are recommending that children wear masks this autumn when they return to school.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,310
Parents and policy makers however are debating whether face coverings should be required.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,340
The delta variant of the coronavirus now threatens to effect normal behavior for the third school year.

4
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:34,530
Some states have decided they will listen to the federal government’s guidance and require masks.

5
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,160
Others will leave the decision up to parents.

6
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:46,380
The situation takes place at a time when many Americans want pandemic restrictions to end.

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,610
Others fear their children will be put at risk by those who do not follow the restrictions.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,990
In a few states, lawmakers passed laws barring schools from requiring masks.

9
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:12,100
In Connecticut, protests against mask requirements have happened outside Governor Ned Lamont’s home in Hartford.

10
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,510
Street signs call on him to “unmask our kids”.

11
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:26,350
The governor has said that he is likely to follow the latest advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

12
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:38,250
Last week, the CDC recommended indoor masks for all teachers, employees, students and visitors at schools nationwide.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,800
It said people should wear masks whether or not they have been vaccinated.

14
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:51,134
The agency said this was to stop the spread of the highly contagious delta variant.

15
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:57,285
The CDC has said even vaccinated people are getting infected.

16
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:01,035
Alima Bryant is the mother of four children.

17
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:07,575
She organizes parents in opposition to mask requirements in Branford, Connecticut.

18
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:16,375
She said she believes scientists have overstated the dangers of COVID-19, especially for children.

19
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:25,765
She said she will take her children out of school rather than force them to wear masks, which she believes are dangerous.

20
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:32,455
“I can imagine how often they’re touching dirty things, then touching the mask,” she said.

21
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:45,000
Other parents such as Ryan Zimmerman, of Lenexa, Kansas, fear the refusal to wear a mask will just keep the pandemic around longer.

22
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,800
In Johnson County, Kansas, five school districts recommend, but do not require, masks.

23
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,850
A sixth school district has not yet decided.

24
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,390
Zimmerman spoke at a recent meeting of county commissioners.

25
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:08,905
He said that if masks are not required “95 percent of kids won’t be wearing them”.

26
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,465
He said requiring masks is not government control.

27
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:19,315
“It is about doing unto others as you want them to do unto you,” he said.

28
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:25,655
But another public meeting in Broward County, Florida, had to be stopped this week.

29
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:34,170
More than 20 parents opposed to masks shouted at school officials and burned masks outside.

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,740
Vivian Hug is a Navy veteran.

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,520
She said she was tired of the “fear mongering” and giving up “freedoms in the name of safety”.

32
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,100
Dr Karyl Rattay is director of the Delaware Division of Public Health.

33
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,950
She said there is no evidence masks are unsafe for children.

34
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:04,440
She said the science is clear that face coverings have prevented the spread of COVID-19 in schools.

35
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,280
“Masks are a key component,” she said, to getting children back in school this year.

36
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,349
There is also a campaign to get older children vaccinated.

37
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,610
President Joe Biden has asked schools to open vaccine centers for children 12 years or older.

38
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:35,760
Some states are also beginning to discuss whether to require school employees to be vaccinated or to regularly take tests for the coronavirus.

39
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:40,695
“To me that seems very reasonable,” said Dr joseph Kanter.

40
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:45,715
He is the state health officer of the Louisiana Department of Health.

41
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,645
“You maintain some choice in there.

42
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:56,265
And clearly most people are going to look at that and say it makes sense for them to get vaccinated,” he said.

43
00:04:57,015 --> 00:05:05,795
The vaccine from the drug company Pfizer is the only US vaccine authorized for children 12 years and up.

44
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:15,270
Moderna expects the Food and Drug Administration to decide soon on its vaccine for children 12 years and up.

45
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,300
All vaccines in the US are available through Emergency Use Authorization only.

46
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:37,455
Moderna also said that it expects to have enough information to ask for FDA approvalof its vaccine for young children by late 2021 or early 2022.

47
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:46,034
Pfizer has said it expects to ask for approval in September for children ages 5 through 11.

48
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:49,844
Kanter urges families to vaccinate all children.

49
00:05:51,240 --> 00:06:00,600
He said the argument that they will rarely get severely ill from COVID-19 is no longer true with the Delta variant.

00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,430
