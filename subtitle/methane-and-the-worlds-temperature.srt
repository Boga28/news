00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,770
Methane is an invisible gas which has no smell.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:17,490
Scientists discovered that methane had much more warming power than carbon dioxide, another gas.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:26,220
Methane caused about 25% of the increase in the global temperature.

4
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:42,805
People can avoid about 30% of the warming, which scientists expect in the next decades, but they wonâ€™t need to make any big changes.

5
00:00:43,915 --> 00:00:55,935
The reason is that oil and gas fields spill methane into the air, and sometimes they do not even know about it.

6
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:07,345
Scientists and so-called methane hunters go around the oil fields, and they find gas leaks.

7
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:19,245
They use a special camera that can see the methane leaking out of pipes and tools which control the flow in the pipes.

8
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:33,115
This is very important because people finally started to see methane as a problem, and they can do something about it.
