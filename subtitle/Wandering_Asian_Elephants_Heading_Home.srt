No one knows why 14 Asian elephants left a protected nature area in China and started walking north about a year ago.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:19,080
But after covering 500 kilometers, the elephants seem to be heading home.

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,380
The elephants are protected in China.

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,650
There are only about 300 in the country.

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,020
During the year that the elephants walked, they became famous in China and around the world.

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,080
They ate crops on farms.

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,780
They entered buildings to find food.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:50,640
Government officials used large trucks, groups of workers and drones to watch the elephants’ activities.

9
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:59,595
The animals made it close to Kunming, a large city in Yunnan province, before turning around.

10
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:03,735
One adult male separated from the group.

11
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:10,335
He was captured and taken back to the protected nature reserve.

12
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:19,005
By the end of the day Sunday, the elephants were still about 200 kilometers from the reserve.

13
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,580
People who have been watching and keeping the elephants safe helped them avoid traffic.

14
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:36,550
They used food to guide them toward a bridge where they could cross the Yuanjiang river.

15
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:52,875
A statement sent from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration said now that the elephants have crossed the river, they are in a safer habitat and making progress toward home.
