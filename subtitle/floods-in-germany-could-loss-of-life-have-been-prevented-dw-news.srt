00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,880
Four days after torrential rains triggered deadly floods in Western Germany survivors have now turned their focus toward the daunting task of rebuilding.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,950
But with emergency services, still busy looking for bodies and securing vital infrastructure.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:22,820
Many residents are left to seek help from volunteers or go with alone son sausages and beer.

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,350
It looks like a village.

5
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:26,610
But it's not what it seems.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,409
This is just a break time for the volunteers organizing an arduous relief effort.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:43,340
Now that the flood water has subsided solidarity is the one thing on everyone's minds here right now, and getting people who have been affected by the floods back on their feet, as quickly as possible.

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,680
People have traveled from nearby villages and further to get here to lend a helping hand with the kids.

9
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:57,130
Over the weekend around 200 cologne football fans descended on the region and have been distributed around the effected areas.

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:12,900
They've been helping locals by rolling up their sleeves, to clear debris from homes, restaurants, and the ruined beer, whole cologne fan Marco helped organize the effort you can't leave people on their own.

11
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,040
You just have to help.

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,590
If it had happened to me, then I'd want someone to.

13
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,385
So I think it's great that people are lending a hand.

14
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:25,155
The generous response has stunned locals, including this hairdresser.

15
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:32,235
She's had a business here for 12 years, but I think there were so many people out there that you don't even know.

16
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:34,065
I don't even know where they come from.

17
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:38,745
They're out here helping to clear up so much willingness to help.

18
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,915
It's wonderful com that's short, short.

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,310
Despite all the volunteers, many people have been left.

20
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,280
Wondering why there hasn't been more help from the authorities.

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,130
Yeah, those at the top are trying to bring order to the chaos, but it's not really working.

22
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,100
A lot of help is coming from volunteers and residents.

23
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:08,210
They're showing an awful lot of initiative, but you can't really say that people at the top of helping, um, yeah.

24
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,170
It's, it's a spirit.

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,610
It's Suzanne, that's just fun.

26
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,210
With so many areas overwhelmed by the floods rescue services, say they're at breaking point.

27
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:27,335
it's pretty difficult to get help to everyone and we have to prioritize.

28
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:35,945
If we get a report that someone's still trapped in a building, then people with watering their basements, they end up being pushed to the back of the queue.

29
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:42,635
There's much work to be done, but many volunteers say they'll stick around long after this week.

30
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:57,875
We'll go chef, our boss has given us Monday and Tuesday off so we can use the time to finish the job, support the local with many residents, still wondering how this disaster could have happened.

31
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:00,125
That help will be much appreciated.

32
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:03,705
Let's bring in our correspondent.

33
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:04,785
Julia saw deli.

34
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,345
Now she's an RV dealer.

35
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:09,405
That's one of the town's worst hit by the floods.

36
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:14,385
Uh, tell us, it's been five days since the flood waters, inundated Arvada and the surrounding region.

37
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:24,905
How are things looking on the ground there now？ any news of the dozens of people reported missing？ well, the devastation is just astounding.

38
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,125
The streets are filled with debris here, here.

39
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:30,245
For example, we have this massive pile of books.

40
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:34,984
This used to be an antiquity store, and now everything is completely destroyed.

41
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,025
The ground floors of homes have been.

42
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,579
Completely filled with water and mud.

43
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,280
So residents have been trying to clean everything up.

44
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:45,040
They have put all their furniture on the streets.

45
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,890
And the problem here is that the streets are quite small.

46
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,970
So it is difficult.

47
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:55,989
For example, for big trucks or excavators to come in and take all these things out and bring them to the dump.

48
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,760
So it is going to take a few days for the town to be cleaned up, but it's not.

49
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:11,470
The loss of objects of things that is also the loss of lives, the number of the dead, it keeps rising up to 116 people dead and only this region.

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,140
And, uh, the authorities, uh, expect, uh, more casualties to, to emerge.

51
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,480
Now, chancellor, I'm going to, uh, came to the region there on Sunday.

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,480
She, uh, she visited and talked to residents.

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,030
Tell us a bit more about what she said on that.

54
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,590
Yeah, well, the chancellor took stock of the devastation that occurred in this region.

55
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:41,040
She said the German language doesn't have any words that are able to describe the, the devastation.

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:49,410
Uh, she also said that she is very much aware that it is going to take a long time for the towns to be cleaned up and rebuilt.

57
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,980
And, uh, she promised the, the population that the government is going to be there in the longterm to try to support them.

58
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:06,130
She thanked, uh, the rescue crews and the many volunteers who came and showed solidarity with the local residents and are helping, uh, with the cleanup.

59
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,190
Do you want me to thank you so much.

60
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,470
That was Julius on deli there in Alma.

61
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:20,595
Well, many people are wondering how this could have happened, uh, that people in the region who were so badly effected were not warned.

62
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,625
Well, let's talk now to Keisler too, about that.

63
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:27,705
He's from the German research center for geosciences in Potsdam.

64
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:29,325
He specializes in flood risk.

65
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:31,135
Forecasting Dr.

66
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:31,465
Shorter.

67
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,575
Thanks for being with us.

68
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,715
Europe has a sophisticated flood warning system in place.

69
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:45,965
You know, all about that yet these floods seem to have taken people completely by surprise what happened？ good morning.

70
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:57,455
Uh, first of all, yeah, the, the flood warning actually is a very difficult, uh, undertaking because, um, it is based on information that is about the future and forecasts about the future.

71
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,655
Always difficult to.

72
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:18,615
Uh, particularly in the case of, uh, flash flood events, as we have seen in, uh, in our Wila and other regions last week, because these flood events have a really rapid onset and you don't have much time actually to provide your information before the flood already occurs to the people.

73
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:22,995
Uh, you have technical issues to solve, to, uh, give them.

74
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,030
Uh, forecast about the location, where it is going to happen.

75
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,229
You have to give the information to the people on the ground.

76
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,460
You have to reach these people.

77
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,409
And this is, uh, always talked about that is the last critical mile.

78
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:47,789
So you have to reach the people, you have to disseminate your information, and you often don't have a confirmation that the information has been received and the general information.

79
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:49,785
And that's that's useful.

80
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:58,605
And I wanted to ask you specifically about what happened in this case, because a British researcher, uh, Hannah cloak, you might know her, she worked on Europe's flood warning system.

81
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:02,715
She alleges that the system in this case did work.

82
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:09,675
She says that German authorities, however, uh, even though they were given precise warnings failed to act, what can you tell us about.

83
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:18,715
But I don't have actually the, the, uh, the company information from the situation on the ground.

84
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:28,585
Uh, I know that the ethos system did work very well also that the German weather service had, uh, provided information that something is going to happened beforehand.

85
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:35,595
But there's, I would just want, wanted to say it, it's difficult to convey this information to the people and also to convey information to the people.

86
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:37,965
They need to do in these cases.

87
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:46,065
Often people have some experience with flooding, but this has not been the same type of flooding, uh, or the same severity of flooding as it happened right now.

88
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:49,844
So maybe they might have underestimated what is going to happen.

89
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:58,034
And this is something that is very, very difficult to control and very, very difficult to, uh, to provide the information the people actually need to do in such cases.

90
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:03,275
Do you have any advice on how catastrophes like this could be.

91
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:18,159
I think, first of all, we really need to take every flood event like this, to really learn from that, not only in this region, but also in other regions.

92
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:28,179
So I think everyone now has to ask himself the question, okay, what would happen in my place？ if such a rainfall would have fallen in such a short time amount.

93
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:32,140
And with this information, you can then try to find out ways.

94
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:39,765
Uh, the impacts of flooding in your region, you can then decide what could be, uh, measures to counteract.

95
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,385
And there you have different possibilities.

96
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:51,334
You can try to control the hazard, but in cases of the event that you see last week, this is something that is purely beyond control of, of technical measures.

97
00:08:51,334 --> 00:09:04,755
So you also need to think about how can I reduce my exposure to flooding？ how can I reduce my vulnerability to flooding？ so what can I do to avoid it？ uh, impacts of flooding if technical control measures do not work anymore.

98
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:05,735
Gotcha.

99
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,475
Just wanted to thank you very much for talking with us.

100
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:11,555
That was  from the German research center for geosciences in Pottstown.

101
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:14,895
Thank you very much.
