1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:10,510
The day before he left for the United States was a busy one for Victor Cal.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:20,710
He went around to family members’ homes to collect money so he could buy food during the long trip north.

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,180
His mother pleaded with him not to leave.

4
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:31,695
But Cal, who is 26, felt he had no choice.

5
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:39,675
After a deadly mudslide, the town where he lived had only hunger and death.

6
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:45,555
It seemed going to the United States was the only way out.

7
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:51,465
Eleven men from his town have gone north this year.

8
00:00:53,084 --> 00:01:03,885
American officials say they have stopped more than 150,000 Guatemalans at the border in 2021.

9
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:09,585
That is four times the number in 2020.

10
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,835
Many were like Victor Cal.

11
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:18,164
They could not find work in Guatemala City.

12
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:24,544
Cal is an Indigenous Mayan who speaks Pocomchí.

13
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:34,639
When the pandemic hit, he was one of thousands who left the capital to return to their farming towns in the mountains.

14
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,740
His father’s land is in Quejá.

15
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,460
With its coffee, corn, cardamom and beans, it sounded like a safe place.

16
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:51,115
At least there would be food, he thought.

17
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:53,305
But he was wrong.

18
00:01:55,455 --> 00:02:05,895
Hurricane Eta and the resulting mudslides had destroyed everything - homes, land and the town.

19
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:13,065
Cal and others became dependent on international aid organizations.

20
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:18,810
They lived in a temporary settlement called Nuevo (new) Quejá.

21
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,370
The old Quejá was not a wealthy place.

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,560
But there had been hard-earned growth over the years.

23
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,410
The community had colorful homes with large windows and electricity.

24
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,270
But all of that was lost to the disaster.

25
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,090
Esma Cal is one of the survivors.

26
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:58,835
(Many of the people of Quejá share the last name of Cal, though it is not clear how some might be related) Esma is an energetic 28-year-old and a great communicator.

27
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:02,165
She became a local leader.

28
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:16,155
By January of this year, Esma Cal, Erwin Cal, Gregorio Ti and others had organized a local rebuilding council.

29
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:24,105
By February, they had founded a temporary settlement on a third of their farmland.

30
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:28,185
That is how Nuevo Quejá was born.

31
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:32,715
The town is home to about 1,000 survivors.

32
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:38,595
“We know how to work,” said Gregorio Ti, 36.

33
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:45,810
He lost his pregnant wife, two young sons and his mother in the mudslide.

34
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,330
His daughters, 11 and 14 years old, survived.

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,280
The work never ends and is backbreaking.

36
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:05,670
All day long, men, women and children cut and transport wood and clear land with their tools.

37
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,260
The temporary shelters have holes in their tops that let rainwater pour inside.

38
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:24,590
Esma Cal’s 37-year-old uncle, Germán Cal, is trying to bring electricity to Nuevo Quejá.

39
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:35,250
But because the town does not officially exist, it cannot get electric poles or road repairs or cleaner water.

40
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:42,075
The Guatemalan government has never been much help to this community.

41
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:48,305
And after the mudslide, it declared the new settlement unlivable.

42
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:55,864
The townspeople have gotten some help from aid organizations.

43
00:04:57,034 --> 00:05:02,015
For example, UNICEF donated a new school to the community.

44
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:12,710
But the school has been closed for about five months because UNICEF gave the key to a teacher who left.

45
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,060
So instead, classes took place in the shelter next door.

46
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,430
The structure leaks, and the floor is often flooded and muddy.

47
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,385
The school serves 250 children and the materials are in Spanish.

48
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:38,655
The students speak only Pocomchi.

49
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:45,965
In addition, the children have begun suffering from poor nutrition.

50
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:53,165
César Chiquin is the head nurse in charge of the area.

51
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:59,305
He said before the hurricane, the children were healthier.

52
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:08,575
“Today, it is rare for a child to have the correct weight and height,” Chiquin said.

53
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:17,635
The people of Nuevo Quejá are unable to grow and raise enough food.

54
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,935
Part of the issue is timing.

55
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:34,640
After losing last year’s crops to the hurricanes, “We arrived in Nuevo Quejá too late for planting properly,” Esma Cal said.

56
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,000
They also have much less land than they did before the storms.

57
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,100
And a lot of the fertile soil was washed away by the rains.

58
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:55,950
The rebuilding council says the town needs about 30 hectares more land.

59
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,390
But the council has no money to buy it.

60
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,930
Someday, the community could be awarded land by the government.

61
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,980
But Guatemalan law says the land does not have to be close by.

62
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:22,575
And the community does not want to move far from their Indigenous lands.

63
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,585
“We need a permanent solution.

64
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:32,094
This place is not fit to live in,” said Esma Cal.

65
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,945
“We, as a farming community, need land”.

66
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:44,595
The people of Nuevo Quejá also need wood for their stoves.

67
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:49,565
So they cut down trees on the mountainside.

68
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:57,795
They understand this puts them at risk for mudslides as the rainy season comes.

69
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:03,075
“We know we can’t be here,” Julio Cal said.

70
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:08,265
“The government has to relocate us on permanent land”.

71
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:15,565
But until then, people are dying in this settlement, one by one.

72
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:22,895
Moving to Guatemala City was not possible for Victor Cal.

73
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:30,655
There were no jobs in the pandemic, and Mayans like him do not speak Spanish.

74
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:37,855
Most of them say the only thing that prevents them from emigrating is the cost.

75
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:51,620
Víctor Cal was able to get a $13,000 loan from a family member in Miami to buy  coyote services.

76
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,610
A coyote in this situation is someone who brings immigrants across the US border secretly.

77
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:12,949
It was four in the morning when Victor wrote down two telephone numbers: his and that of his coyote.

78
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,050
He put the paper on the table for his parents.

79
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:24,650
After he left, he said, “If I had a choice, I wouldn’t go.

80
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,339
I will be back as soon as possible”.

81
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,020
I’m Alice Bryant.

82
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
And I'm Dan Friedell.
