A group of scientists has proposed a new theory about how Earth’s atmosphere got its oxygen: the planet slowed down and days got longer.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:27,210
A recent study proposes that longer, continuous daylight caused bacteria to produce lots of oxygen.

3
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:34,065
That oxygen made most of life as we know it possible.

4
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:50,474
The scientists dug up bad smelling, colorful bacteria from a deep sinkhole in Lake Huron, which is one of the Great Lakes in the northern United States.

5
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:58,650
In laboratory experiments, the researchers gave the bacteria different amounts of light.

6
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:09,780
They found that the bacteria produce oxygen at a higher rate the longer they receive continuous light.

7
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:21,930
One of the great mysteries in science is how Earth went from a planet with little oxygen to the breathable air we have now.

8
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:31,755
Scientists long believed that microorganisms called cyanobacteria were involved.

9
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:38,865
But they do not know what started the great oxygenation event.

10
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:47,625
The researchers released their study in the publication Nature Geoscience this month.

11
00:01:49,390 --> 00:02:01,900
It suggests that Earth’s slowing rotation made it possible for the cyanobacteria to make the atmosphere able to support life.

12
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:12,250
Over a long period, Earth went from a six-hour rotation to its current 24-hour rotation.

13
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:24,355
The scientists say that 2,4 billion years ago there was almost no oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere.

14
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:31,735
No animal or plant that we know of could live in such conditions.

15
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:38,635
Instead, lots of bacteria breathed carbon dioxide gas.

16
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:48,804
In the case of cyanobacteria, they produced oxygen in the earliest form of photosynthesis.

17
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:52,975
At first it was not much.

18
00:02:54,054 --> 00:03:04,404
But after about 400 million years, Earth’s atmosphere reached one-tenth the amount of oxygen we have today.

19
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:13,030
That is a huge jump, said the study’s lead writer, Judith Klatt.

20
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,690
She is an expert at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.

21
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,400
The increased oxygen permitted plants and animals to develop over time.

22
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:35,570
And plants began joining the oxygen-making party, she said.

23
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:48,590
But why did bacteria begin to make more oxygen？ brian Arbic is an ocean expert at the University of Michigan.

24
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,650
He studies tidal forces on Earth and how they have slowed Earth’s rotation.

25
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:07,960
Arbic says planet’s rotation slowed because of tidal friction and Earth’s relationship with the moon.

26
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:24,640
Researchers from the University of Michigan and from Germany tested their ideas with bacteria similar to what would have existed 2,4 billion years ago.

27
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:39,289
They used white and purple mats of cyanobacteria living 24 meters underwater in the sinkhole in lake Huron.

28
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:51,400
“We actually imagine that the world looked kind of like the Middle Island sinkhole for most of its history,” Klatt said.

29
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:59,335
Divers brought up the mats of bacteria, which smell like very old eggs.

30
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:09,955
Klatt and others exposed them to different amounts of light, up to 26 straight hours.

31
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:18,804
They found that more continuous light causes the bacteria to produce more oxygen.

32
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:32,174
The writers of the study and outside scientists said this is just one possible reason for Earth’s oxygen increase.

33
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:46,934
What makes the idea interesting is that it does not require any big biological changes in bacteria or the world’s oceans, said Tim Lyons.

34
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:57,905
He is a professor at the University of California, Riverside and was not part of the research team.

35
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,455
I’m Alice Bryant.
