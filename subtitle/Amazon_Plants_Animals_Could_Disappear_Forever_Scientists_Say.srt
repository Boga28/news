00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:13,220
A new report says that more than 10,000 kinds of living things could disappear forever because of the Amazon rainforest’s destruction.

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,920
The rainforest surrounding South America’s Amazon River is the world’s largest.

3
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:30,000
The report said 35 percent of the rainforest has been destroyed or damaged.

4
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,910
The report is by the Science Panel for the Amazon.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,190
The project brought together 200 international scientists through the United Nations Sustainable Development Network.

6
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,560
It is a detailed study of the Amazon rainforest and its importance to the world’s climate.

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:08,720
Reducing deforestation and forest destruction to zero in less than 10 years“is critical,” the report said.

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,740
The scientists also called for replanting trees that were destroyed.

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:26,340
The rainforest stores large amounts of carbon and is extremely important in fighting climate change.

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:36,860
The report said that the plants and soil of the Amazon hold 200 billion metric tons of carbon.

11
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,280
That is 400 percent of the world's yearly carbon dioxide emissions.

12
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:59,714
The continued destruction of the Amazon rainforest also threatens more than 8,000 plants and 2,300 animals, the report added.

13
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:07,785
Mercedes Bustamante is a professor at the University of Brasilia.

14
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:14,595
She spoke in an online presentation of some of the study’s findings.

15
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:22,815
She said the destruction of the Amazon also presents a serious risk to humans.

16
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:31,015
”There is a narrow window of opportunity to change this trajectory,” she said“.

17
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:38,145
The fate of Amazon is central to the solution to the global” crisis.

18
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:47,765
Colombia’s former President Juan Manuel Santos also spoke during the online discussion.

19
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:56,195
He said there has been a lack of political leadership among the eight countries in the Amazon area.

20
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:09,495
The report said 18 percent of the Amazon area has already been deforested -- mostly for agriculture and illegal timber.

21
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:15,105
Another 17 percent of the rainforest has been damaged.

22
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:28,280
Scientists said the main goal should be protecting existing plants and bodies of water rather than repairing damaged areas.

23
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:37,430
Marielos Peña-Claros is a professor at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.

24
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:51,630
She said:“Restoration actions can be costly and complex to implement, so it's actually better to avoid deforestation,” she said.

25
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:05,300
A separate study, released in the science publication Nature, said that some parts of the Amazon are releasing more carbon than they take in.

26
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:13,475
Luciana Gatti from Brazil's space research agency led the study.

27
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:25,835
She said carbon emissions are highest in the southeastern part of the Amazon area, where there are high rates of deforestation.

28
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:34,475
She said many trees there are dying from lack of rain and rising temperatures.

29
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,859
