1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,260
Halfway between the United States and Japan is Alaska’s Adak Island.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,730
It is one of the remote Aleutian islands.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,079
It is a place known for its natural beauty.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,160
The coast is home to rich wildlife.

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,650
Purple lupine flowers can be seen along roads through grassy hills.

6
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:31,365
Hot springs cover the landscape.

7
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:38,445
Snow-topped mountains and the Great Sitkin volcano rise in the distance.

8
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:45,614
It is also a strange place, with an important military history.

9
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:56,385
Adak became a US armyArmy airbase during World War II to protect against a feared Japanese invasion of Alaska.

10
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:00,585
The base was later used by the Navy.

11
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:12,795
Because of its closeness to Russia, it remained an important military base and submarine look-out center throughout the Cold War.

12
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:18,765
Adak Island is home to the native Aleut people.

13
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:21,884
It is not easy to get to.

14
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:26,505
It requires a four-hour plane trip from Anchorage.

15
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:36,994
People visit Adak to hunt, watch birds, climb mountains, or examine one of the many abandoned military bases.

16
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:45,395
American writer Nicole Evatt recently described her travels there for The Associated Press.

17
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:56,805
She describes two Adaks: one filled with beautiful nature and one filled with Cold War military remains.

18
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:10,615
Like many other historical areas on Adak, the old LORAN --- long range navigation --- station is covered with painted words, called graffiti.

19
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,345
And it is falling apart.

20
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:16,705
The doors and windows are broken.

21
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:21,235
Evatt calls the inside of the buildings “spooky”.

22
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:33,035
As she walked through dark, partly wet rooms, paint was coming off the surfaces and broken equipment sat in disrepair.

23
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:42,125
Through broken windows, she saw the blue-black Bering Sea crashing into nearby Horseshoe Bay.

24
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:50,915
This is the Adak experience: equal parts spooky and breathtaking natural beauty.

25
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,990
But the real reason to visit Adak is not the military buildings.

26
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,770
Most people come to hunt caribou.

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,680
The animal was introduced to the area in the 1950s as a possible emergency food source.

28
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,990
Along with hunting, people also come to hike.

29
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,920
There are many beautiful hikes on the island.

30
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,370
One at Finger Bay offers views of the volcano.

31
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:36,260
A hike to Lake Bonnie Rose includes an old abandoned military building built into hills.

32
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:45,380
At Horseshoe Bay, brave people can climb down a rope to the coast below and nearby hot springs.

33
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:57,915
At Clam Lagoon you can watch sea otters, harbor seals and sea lions playing in the water and warming themselves on the rocks.

34
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:02,874
For bird watchers, the area is wonderful.

35
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:09,135
And Adak’s strange “national forest” is also worth a visit.

36
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:18,690
This is a small collection of evergreen trees in an otherwise nearly treeless landscape.

37
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:27,300
In town, fewer than 100 people live full-time in old military houses.

38
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:35,490
These houses sit in mostly empty neighborhoods with other buildings in need of repair.

39
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,550
So why do people stay？ some love the quiet.

40
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:46,935
Others say they feel safe from the coronavirus.

41
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:51,395
Some get extra pay for remote work.

42
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:56,765
People who live there often do many different jobs.

43
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:03,305
One man who serves drinks at a bar also works at the airport.

44
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:09,985
Adak locals learn to live with very limited supplies.

45
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:14,985
The only food store is in the old daycare center.

46
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:20,085
It is open just a few hours on some evenings.

47
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:29,775
The old high school and middle school now hold city hall, a healthcare center and the post office.

48
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:37,425
A drink store that was once a gas station sells a case of beer for $50.

49
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,420
In most states, a case of beer is under $20.

50
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,230
Food choices are limited.

51
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,700
Restaurants and stores are often closed.

52
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:01,990
One eatery in Adak does not open often, but when it does, it serves a large pizza for $28.

53
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:14,575
Reporter Nicole Evatt wrote that it was surprisingly tasty considering how far the tomato sauce and cheese had to travel.

54
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:16,785
I’m Anna Matteo.
