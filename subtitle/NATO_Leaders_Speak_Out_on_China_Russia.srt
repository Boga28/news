00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:13,290
Leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Monday said the growing influence of China was an important issue for the alliance.

2
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:30,915
In a final statement, NATO leaders described China’s growing military as “presenting challenges,” which some experts considered surprisingly strong language.

3
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:37,095
The statement also described Russia as “a threat”.

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:48,750
US president Joe Biden arrived at the 31st NATO leaders meeting in Brussels with an important goal.

5
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:59,519
He said he wanted to get NATO allies to deal with problematic actions by China and Russia.

6
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:08,345
He also said he wanted to win the trust of members of the 30-country alliance.

7
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:13,384
“NATO stands together,” said Biden.

8
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:25,384
After arriving at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels, Biden spoke with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.

9
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:39,395
Biden has said he wants NATO members to speak out on issues of trade, defense and human rights that relate to China and Russia.

10
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:49,024
The actions of those nations have become important foreign policy concerns for the Biden administration.

11
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:55,354
NATO members considered a new cyber defense policy.

12
00:01:56,265 --> 00:02:07,245
It would permit a country hit by a ransomware attack to work together with other members for their common defense.

13
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:20,175
This comes after Russian-based hackers carried out a series of attacks targeting the US government and worldwide businesses.

14
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:39,390
The update will mean that if an alliance member needs technological or intelligence support to fight a cyberattack, it would be able to call on Article 5 to receive assistance.

15
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:51,495
Article 5 of the alliance charter states that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members.

16
00:02:53,255 --> 00:03:06,425
Members also accepted a climate security action plan to reduce the release of gases linked to climate change from military activities.

17
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:18,899
Alliance members also accepted a commitment to strengthen NATO’s deterrence to meet threats from Russia and other places.

18
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:36,299
At a press event following the summit, Biden said that he will tell Russian President Vladimir Putin when they meet on Wednesday that he “will respond” to Russian aggression.

19
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:47,220
Biden also said that the possible death of Putin critic Alexei Navalny would be a “tragedy”.

20
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,910
He said it would prove that Putin did not believe in human rights.

21
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,709
Navalny is imprisoned in Russia and reported to be very sick.

22
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:13,275
Biden was also asked about the future of Ukraine and the possibility that it could join NATO in the future.

23
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:19,425
“They have to meet the criteria” Biden answered.

24
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:31,005
Biden called Article 5 “sacred” and added, “I want NATO to know America is there”.

25
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,145
I’m Mario Ritter, Jr.
