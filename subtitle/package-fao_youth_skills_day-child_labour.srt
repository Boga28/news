1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:15,480
It's low tide at Cambodia's Tom lane, SAP Southeast Asia is the largest freshwater lake fishing boats returned to the docks.

2
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,420
Well, children play on the mud flats.

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,940
They're joyful cries are a stark contrast to Tom's the room's childhood.

4
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:25,665
Yeah, I believe of watching.

5
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,855
I'm like Dalton in my childhood.

6
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,705
I helped my mother make steamed rice cakes to sell.

7
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,865
It says the 41 year old crouching as she ski was small fish.

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,620
For as long as the room can remember, work has been a part of her life.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,360
I needed to wake up very early in the morning.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,720
I wrote a boat from one village to the next to sell the cakes.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,040
Yeah.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,900
After her father passed away.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,910
So the room had to support her mother.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,520
The one that was why I quit school.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,700
So room story is not uncommon.

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:16,410
19% of Cambodian children aged five to 17 work most in agriculture, especially fisheries fishing and rice cultivation are the backbone of the country's economy.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,970
They're integral to Cambodian cultural identity and food security.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,040
While Tom lay stopped, lake contributes over half of the country's fish production.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,180
It's 4.8 million residents are some of Asia's poorest.

20
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:40,815
Many faced extreme poverty and parents have no choice, but to send their children to work explains one time from the commune committee for women and girls.

21
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:46,115
pause 10 to 15 years.

22
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:48,455
There's been a lot of child labor in the community.

23
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:54,335
They always bring their children fishing with them and they use the children to work for others to get extra income for their family.

24
00:01:56,015 --> 00:02:02,435
Well, while it's legal in Cambodia for children aged 15 to 17.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,230
What's not legal is when that work violates their rights.

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:07,880
Child.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:26,930
Labor is defined as a work, but is inappropriate for chance age, if it affects or interferes with a child's education, or if it is likely to harm their health and safety that's child labor expert, Arianne John, Tom from the food and agriculture organization of the United nations.

28
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:45,855
She says that when children, without on an education, they miss out on so much more child labor hinders children from reaching their full potential and their future chance of getting decent employment, child labor, pet Patriots, a cycle of rural poverty.

29
00:02:54,575 --> 00:03:02,915
Quite FAO is working closely with the Cambodian government and partner organizations to address the root causes of child labor.

30
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:13,445
This includes developing awareness, raising materials and visual tools to promote gender equity and to protect children from hazardous work in fisheries.

31
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:17,105
FAO also provides trainings to fisheries association.

32
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,580
In helping identify and prevent child labor.

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:29,550
Some children took part in a training on child labor prevention as chief of the community fisheries committee.

34
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:36,240
He travels to fishing villages in Kampong tenon province to raise awareness about child labor.

35
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:49,595
Today, he's organized a community meeting in Khan Lang pay village  I visited some families and explained to each family about child labor to make it clear to them.

36
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:56,345
fishing villages are often isolated with limited access to schools and transportation.

37
00:03:57,185 --> 00:04:01,715
As a result, many adults Fisher folk are illiterate and face poverty.

38
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:06,375
Children's mission is to encourage them to send their children to school.

39
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,545
He explains to them how the communities stands to benefit as well.

40
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,685
suppose we can eliminate child labor in the community.

41
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,555
In that case, our community gets many advantages.

42
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:26,675
Why once enough children going back to school, then there are resources in the company.

43
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:39,920
Yeah, early morning in condominium, paid village, only fish of folk and a chorus of cicadas are awake at this hour.

44
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,920
So room's door touch.

45
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:50,090
I'm concierge sits cross-legged in the dark, concentrated by her book, which she reads under Torchlight.

46
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,240
Normally the teenager would be getting up at this hour to go fishing with her.

47
00:04:56,295 --> 00:05:03,875
But these days, she wakes up early to study every day I get up at five.

48
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,625
O'clock read a little and get ready to go to school at six o'clock.

49
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:15,305
No mom boy, thanks to joint efforts by FAO and the Cambodian government come see is enrolled in school.

50
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:22,085
Instead of child labor, every day, she rides a motorbike to school, denied it on the mound.

51
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:23,135
No, my own puck.

52
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:23,645
It takes.

53
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,980
At 7:00 AM I arrive at school, but then I leave school at 10 o'clock.

54
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,900
I arrive home at 11 o'clock.

55
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,010
I have lunch.

56
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,570
And then I go fishing with my dad.

57
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:45,500
she helps her dad catch real fish, used to make Prague a salty fermented fish paste, commonly used in Cambodian cuisine long long.

58
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,780
When I go fishing, I throw gillnets.

59
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:52,695
I released the fish from the gillnets and I take off the scales or the efficient skin.

60
00:05:56,945 --> 00:06:09,695
Then she helps her mother clean and prepare the fish to either smoke or sell I'm back home at five in the evening, I helped my mother peel the remaining fish until it's done at around six or six.

61
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:26,030
these days just catching enough fish for dinner can be a challenge as fish numbers in toddler lace-up lake, continue to decline even more reason for children like come yet to get an education.

62
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,390
And man, that Dean, if my daughter could pass her grade 12, I would be very excited.

63
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,460
She wants her daughter to have the opportunities that she never had.

64
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,880
I've owned  I do not want my children to be illiterate.

65
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:50,050
Like me fighting child labor through education helps break the cycle of poverty.

66
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,289
It keeps children safe and teaches them new skills to find jobs that earn a more stable income

67
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,479
concierge performs well at school.

68
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,700
And although she still works for her family.

69
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,030
She attends class regularly.

70
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,310
Thanks to the full support of her.

71
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,020
Her dream is to one day become a teacher in her own community.

72
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,670
A nickname could come from, I want to be a teacher in the village because there is always a shortage of teachers.

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:33,020
If there is a teacher in a village, it is easy to educate children and allow them to acquire knowledge, which just goes to show that fighting child labor through education.

74
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,690
Really does benefit everyone.
