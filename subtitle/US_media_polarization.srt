1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,860
We're going to show you next, a little bit of a sneak peek of a brand new CBC documentary.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,750
It is called big news.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,330
It premiers today on CBC gem.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,280
So you can stream it as of today.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:22,260
You're going to see in this doc, the way us news, media, stoke partisan division in the us, how social media, how fake news and mistrust have politicized.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,380
The pandemic have politicized protest.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,630
Here's an excerpt of today's documentary.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,850
I think we underestimate the power of the media to shape our worldviews.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,019
We were no longer consuming the same story.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,750
People only want to watch what they already agree with.

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,905
We are so polarized that we will polarized around absolutely, Anything.

12
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:56,345
Moving ever closer to this cliff.

13
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:08,215

“Shooting guys”

14
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:16,380
When the coronavirus came along, you desperately needed to know the truth.

15
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:21,600
“I disagree, you're where you're going to have your thoughts to where I'm at.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,919
I disagree science”

17
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,639
They're simply incapable of reporting on the country in ways that a lot of people in the country would understand.

18
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:44,935
Big news from the documentary.

19
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:52,345
Look who's with us this morning, our senior correspondent in Washington, Paul Hunter, my heart is pounding for, from that promo.

20
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,515
I mean, obviously.

21
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,765
It is a very dramatic documentary, but it gets to some very important issues.

22
00:01:57,765 --> 00:02:02,205
And Paul is with us this morning to talk about things good morning and welcome back.

23
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:03,304
Nice to see you Paul.

24
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:04,335
For a long time.

25
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:08,595
I know I was thinking it was inauguration day, January 20th, that we last saw you.

26
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:21,565
And we're going to talk about some of the things that relate to that, but let me get you to get your perspective overall, this documentary, what, what you see it's trying to do, because part of your work is part of this, but, uh, what you see the documentary is trying to do and how it mirrors.

27
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:43,600
What you have experienced and witnessed in your 10 years covering the US political scene, such a, such a small, simple question, Heather, you know, I hear your voice in it for a snippet, or there's a snippet of me, sympathy of our friend, Steve D'Souza, but mostly it looks at the US media and the sort of, what it really tries to do is connect the dots.

28
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:58,065
To explain or try to how we got to where we are right now, which is, you know, a place where people don't trust the news, where people don't know where to find the news and what to think of it.

29
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,255
When they see it, how did we get here?

30
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:08,265
How did this country society get to a place where it is so polarized, where there aren't conversations anymore.

31
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:10,755
There are just angry, shouting matches.

32
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,340
Among politicians among media.

33
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,440
How do people find the truth?

34
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,640
How did we get here?

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:28,950
It tracks, it goes back to the Dawn of public broadcasting, but mostly it looks really at the last 20, 30 years, uh, during the rise of this period, that again gets us to the point where we are now.

36
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,359
It's quite a dark, I've watched the whole thing.

37
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,410
That was a great little promo.

38
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:39,660
And it's about an hour long it's, um, it's instructive and it's kind of sobering, you know, because we've come to.

39
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:46,080
No, the world was at a point where they thought, you know, all information will come from the news.

40
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,020
And now the news is questioned.

41
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,640
Doubted not believed.

42
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:52,545
By millions of people.

43
00:03:52,545 --> 00:04:07,985
And that's a challenge for democracy, little clip for you, Paul, and it's not from the documentary, but it just speaks to how the current president Joe Biden is dealing with the climate that exists presently and how people don't believe that they are getting the truth.

44
00:04:07,985 --> 00:04:18,545
So let's watch this and then we'll, we'll bring it back to the, uh, the discussion last summer I was in Philadelphia and I met a small business owner, a woman.

45
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,870
I asked her, I said, what do you need most, never get what she said to me.

46
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,440
She said, looking from behind the ice, he said, I just want the truth, the truth.

47
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,320
Just tell me the truth.

48
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,870
Think of that.

49
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,960
My fellow Americans you're owed nothing less than the truth.

50
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,990
So as he addressed the American population there in that prime primetime special.

51
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,295
I just want the truth.

52
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:56,175
When, when did that departure occur?

53
00:04:56,175 --> 00:05:02,405
Paul, you know, I thought there was a remarkable moment, uh, in Biden's speech, uh, that night, a couple of weeks ago.

54
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,065
Um, you kind of hear that from people all the time.

55
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:10,745
You know, if I'm going out talking to, you know, regular people, uh, it's interesting.

56
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:14,975
The last, I would say the last 10, 15 years, people want to know who you work for.

57
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,380
Uh, what's your agenda.

58
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:17,520
Do you have an agenda?

59
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,469
What is your network about, what is your story about because people, they are wary of bias.

60
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:33,739
They are wary of non-truths and like, you know, the woman in Joe Biden's story, people just want the truth and they don't know how to find it.

61
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:38,210
You know, in the documentary, to me, there's a couple of turning points in all of this.

62
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,770
There's the rise of Fox news.

63
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,760
There's Donald Trump and, and the repetition of fake news and all that kind of stuff.

64
00:05:44,145 --> 00:06:03,875
But at one point, the documentary looks at, um, the, the program crossfire, if you remember that, um, where they would get somebody on, on the left and somebody on the right and have what was ostensibly a debate and what extensively presented as a kind of news and information program.

65
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:09,395
Um, but what the documentary underlines is that it was, it was, it was an us versus them.

66
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:11,284
It was a, this team versus that team.

67
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:12,175
And that, that.

68
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,510
Isn't really helpful.

69
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,659
They, they show a Jon Stewart clip where he calls them out on this.

70
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:24,960
Um, and what that program led to was a polarization of people.

71
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,680
It's us, them there's no middle ground.

72
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,429
You know, I talk to journalism students a lot, uh, over the, over the course of years.

73
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:46,995
And yeah, I have often made the point that that you'll encounter a tension to be, you know, One side or the other, because that's somehow sexier the, that the tension in that is makes for a sexier more interesting story, but right.

74
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:51,615
But the truth is usually somewhere in the middle and your job is to get to the truth.

75
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:54,705
Sometimes all the time, that's not black or white, that's gray.

76
00:06:55,365 --> 00:07:01,635
Your job is to make that story interesting and valuable, but that's what the news is about the truth and get to the truth.

77
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:05,445
So get away from the, this side or that side of the shouting matches that can ensue.

78
00:07:05,445 --> 00:07:06,015
It may be.

79
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:14,354
Entertaining to watch, but it's at the end of the day, it, it may not be valuable for people that are just trying to get information.

80
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:15,945
So interesting.

81
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:23,145
Would you talk about the polarization and then the fact that, I mean, as we heard in that promo clip, that people only are interested in listening what they already believe.

82
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:29,265
You know, they're not listening and learning to the other side or talking to the other side or it's that echo chamber mentality that continues.

83
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:30,335
I want to bring back.

84
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:41,794
We saw that image very briefly, but when you bring in fake news, this phrase that we all know, uh, alternative facts, I think back to that from 2017, that was a key turning point moment I would imagine.

85
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:42,294
But.

86
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,000
With the election of Donald Trump.

87
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:56,480
And then now of late the pandemic, here's the picture that we're going to look as, you know, that when he returned from the hospital, after having being treated for COVID-19 and makes that triumphant return up the steps of the white house, uh, just bear with me.

88
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,040
We're going to look at that image again.

89
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,130
Oh, it is eclipse or Paul will watch this and we'll talk about it in just a second.

90
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,690
Sure, yeah.

91
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,730
So, sorry.

92
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,510
There is no sound there.

93
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,530
Yeah, there's the image.

94
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,160
And then that.

95
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,170
Cam, you can see the bulbs flashing he's up the stairs and there he is.

96
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,370
And he takes off the mask.

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,450
How has all of that Trump and the pandemic, how was it all exacerbated?

98
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:39,320
Things know there's another, you know, another, I think, um, instructive moment in the documentary, uh, uh, where it's Leslie stall from 60 minutes talking with Donald Trump about his sort of perpetual, um, disparaging of the news and you know, the fake news, et cetera.

99
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,049
And he says she recounts that he tells her.

100
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:50,295
That he says that so that people will believe him, not people who are filtering his message or, or saying what they want about.

101
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,675
And they will only believe him.

102
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:55,545
I've I've, you know, thought for a long time.

103
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:59,535
The two most powerful words in his lexicon were fake news.

104
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:02,805
And he had been to places where he will do that at those rallies.

105
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:07,335
And then people will turn and do the CNN sucks, you know, to the media pen in the middle.

106
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,785
And he creates, he again, builds on this.

107
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:17,520
You're on one team or the other you're either with me or you're with the, you know, the enemy of the people, the media, as he put it.

108
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,130
And you know, we talk about the bully pulpit that the president has.

109
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:27,360
When you say this often enough as president people tend to believe it.

110
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:27,870
Right.

111
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,700
And that's a challenge for the media.

112
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,990
I mean, we've got to do our job.

113
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,040
We've got to call that out.

114
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,630
We've got to fact check.

115
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,830
We've got to tell stories.

116
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,080
We've got to demonstrate what the other side is.

117
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:54,510
But it's complicated and it's hard because that's a very powerful position to be in as president, you know, even, you know, during COVID for example, when he comes out and he starts talking about, you know, hydroxychloroquine or bleach or sunlight, and by he, I mean, any president, right?

118
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,870
How do you, how do you know what the truth is?.

119
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,570
Even as a journalist, maybe he heard something in the oval office that he's, he can't really explain.

120
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:11,025
There's not a Liberty to, or whatever, or is it just wrong or is it a false information or is it a lie you don't know.

121
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,855
And how do you get to that?

122
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:22,005
It's kind of circular in the end, but it has become a complicated thing to do it, it, you know, to cover politics in this country in the last 10, 15.

123
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:25,564
So let's look to consequences in the future and I'm going to.

124
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,995
Bask for some footage of what we saw on January the sixth.

125
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:40,725
When you talk about the presidential bully pulpit, and you can see in these pictures of the Capitol riots, you see how people responded to what the president said, the consequences of this kind of, uh, of this kind of discussion.

126
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:54,935
Then it makes you wander again in, in, in conjunction with this documentary, Paul, the consequences of this debate and in this kind of messaging and how on earth do we ever get it back?

127
00:10:55,625 --> 00:11:14,285
Look, Heather, the thing is the other, I think failure of big media, the industry, not the documentary, um, is for too long, too many news organizations, um, ignored too many voices in America.

128
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:17,915
You know, the reason the us versus them grabbed hold.
