A top Chinese official has called for “all-round efforts” to ensure Tibetans speak and write in Chinese.

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:22,290
The official, Wang Yang, spoke at a recent ceremony in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa.

3
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:31,985
The building is the ancient home of the Dalai Lamas, leaders of traditional Tibetan Buddhism.

4
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:45,275
In his speech, Wang said all Tibetans must share in, what he called, “cultural symbols and images of the Chinese nation”.

5
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:53,905
The official is a member of the small and powerful Politburo Standing Committee.

6
00:00:55,195 --> 00:01:06,625
The ceremony was held to mark the 70th anniversary of the Chinese invasion of what is now the Tibet Autonomous Region.

7
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:22,710
China has ruled the large Himalayan area since 1951, when the People’s Liberation Army seized the territory in what it calls a “peaceful liberation”.

8
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:33,530
“Tibet can only develop and prosper under the party's leadership and socialism,” Wang said.

9
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,060
China has also pointed to its efforts to improve the economy in the area.

10
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:52,764
Critics say China’s moves to expand Chinese cultural influences threaten Tibet’s traditional Buddhist culture.

11
00:01:53,905 --> 00:02:01,134
Chinese leaders condemn the current, widely-accepted Dalai Lama as a separatist.

12
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:05,125
He lives in exile in northern India.

13
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:18,394
Wang said, “separatist and sabotage activities committed by the Dalai (Lama) group and hostile external forces have been crushed”.

14
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:37,940
He added that since 1951, Tibet had taken “a path from darkness to brightness, from backwardness to progress, from poverty to prosperity and from autocracy to democracy”.

15
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:48,230
The US -based International Campaign for Tibet, however, sees Tibet’s past progress very differently.

16
00:02:49,815 --> 00:03:02,745
“Judging by developments in Tibet over the past 70 years, the Tibetan people have no cause for jubilation,” the group said in a statement.

17
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:16,755
It added: “Chinese policies have turned Tibet itself into an open-air prison with restrictions on all aspects of Tibetan life”.

18
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:30,505
China recognizes the current Panchen Lama -- who was put in place by the Chinese Communist Party -- as the highest religious official in Tibet.

19
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:43,585
As a mark of the party's rule over Tibetan Buddhism, Wang presented the Panchen Lama with a special memorial during the ceremony.
