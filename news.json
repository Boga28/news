   "metin":"Four former police officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota last year are to face a federal civil rights trial.

\tA federal grand jury has decided to bring charges against the four accusing them of violating George Floyd’s constitutional rights. A grand jury is a group of citizens who study evidence to decide if there should be a trial in a legal case. The decision was made public Friday.

\tFloyd died after officers restrained him on the ground during his arrest on May 25, 2020. During the arrest, Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe in an incident which was filmed and shown all over the world.

The charges

\tDerek Chauvin is charged with violating Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force.

\tTou Thao and J Alexander Keung are also charged with violating Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure. The charging document alleges that the two did not try to stop Chauvin as he put a knee on Floyd’s neck.

All four officers, Chauvin, Keung, Thao, and Thomas Lane, are charged with failure to provide Floyd with medical care.

\tChauvin is also charged in connection with the arrest and restraint of a 14-year-old boy in 2017.

\tThree of the former officers, Lane, Thao and Keung, appeared before the US District Court in Minneapolis through a video link. Chauvin was not part of the court appearance.

\tIn April, a court in Minneapolis found Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter charges brought by the state of Minnesota. He is being held in a high security prison in the state as he waits for his sentence to be decided by a judge.

\tThe three former officers named by the federal grand jury also face state charges in a trial planned for August. They are free after paying a bond to ensure that they appear for trial.

The incident

\tThe charges are the result of the arrest of Floyd last year. The officers stopped Floyd after he was accused of trying to use false money at a store and acting unusually. Court evidence states that Floyd resisted being arrested.

\tChauvin then restrained Floyd on the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes. State lawyers say that Kueng placed his knee on Floyd’s back and Lane held down Floyd’s legs during the arrest. The state lawyers also say Thao held a gathering crowd back and prevented them from intervening in the arrest.

\tEric Nelson, Chauvin’s lawyer argued during his murder trial that the former officer acted reasonably in the situation. He said that Floyd died of existing health problems and was using drugs at the time. He also requested a new trial for Chauvin noting several issues. Among the issues was that the judge did not move the trial to another place although the incident caused violent protests in Minneapolis.

\tFloyd’s arrest was captured on video by many people who gathered around the arrest. The incident brought public anger and protests, both peaceful and violent, across the country against police use of force and racial inequality.

   "metin":"Ana Saul Romero has seen many changes in teaching methods, testing, and technology during her forty years as a teacher. But this year, she said, has given her a lifetime’s worth of changes.
\n\tIn her first-grade class in Manor, Texas, just outside of Austin, only 12 students are inside the classroom. The other half of the class join in from home by video. Romero now stands behind a clear divider working with a pointer, a laptop, and a few other technologies to teach her students.
\nSuper teachers
\n\tRomero said, “it is difficult with the technology, and I have learned more, but it is not enough, it is never enough.” She said she is from an older generation and she misses the daily, in-person connections with her students.
\n\tFirst-year teacher Cindy Hipps is Romero’s teaching partner. She said it was like being “introduced to the ring of fire of teaching.” She added, “I feel like a superwoman now.”
\n\tThis spring marks a year since the coronavirus pandemic shut down schools across the United States. It forced many students, parents, and teachers into virtual classrooms.
\n\tAs states permitted larger groups to gather, some students have since returned to school. Many schools now use a combination of virtual and in-person instruction in class. And teachers like Romero have to learn new ways of teaching all the students.
\nLast school year
\n\tAdding to the difficulties, not all students have equal access to internet and technology. There were political and social protests across the country. And many tired educators are wondering if this will be their last school year.
\n\tAntoinette Miranda is an Ohio State University professor of school psychology. She is also on the state’s school board and is married to a high school teacher.
\n\tShe said that educators are dealing with the pandemic’s effects on themselves and their family. They also are trying to support students, some with troubles in school and some without food at home while being separated from friends.
\n\t“We talk a lot about the stress on students,” Miranda said, “but I think there’s a tremendous amount of stress on teachers.”
\n\tSome people blamed teachers who raised concerns on health and safety for delaying school re-openings. They felt it put pressure on parents. But Miranda thinks “there’s also a renewed respect for teachers. especially parents that had to start teaching their kids at home.”
\n\tAndre Spencer is head of the Manor Independent School District where Romero works. He said the schools centered on helping students and teachers during the pandemic. They spent millions to provide every student and teacher the technology for virtual learning, including mobile internet access.
\n\tEven before the start of this school year, school supervisors like Spencer were already worried that there would be a shortage of teachers and school workers.
\n\tThe National Education Association is one of the nation’s largest representatives for teachers. The organization found that more than one in four teachers felt the pandemic increased their plans to retire early or leave the profession.
\n\tRandi Weingarten is president of American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, another teacher’s organization. She believes there will be more teachers retiring in the coming months after a year of unknowns, change, and stress. And AFT has started a program to help members who were affected by COVID-19.
\nTeaching controversial topics
\n\tBut there were other issues that affect teachers, especially teachers of color, this past year. They include national conversations around racial injustice, the presidential election, and the attack on the US Capitol.
\n\tTravis Bristol is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He suggests schools provide employees time to talk about what they have been through. He says teachers who have been supported in dealing with their own stress will be better able to help students do the same.
\n\tRomero, the first-grade teacher in Texas, was considering retiring. But she now looks forward to the new school year.
\n\tShe said, “We will have the experience of an entire year of trying. That’s what educators do. We try and we fail and we get up and we shake it off and we do it again.”
